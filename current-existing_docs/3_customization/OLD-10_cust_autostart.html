<body>
<p>This article explains how to automatically start playback of your media on page load. Since autostarting can be annoying at times, we&#39;ll also mute the media by default. Here is an example:</p>

<div id="container">&nbsp;</div>
<script>
var playerInstance = jwplayer("container");
playerInstance.setup({
  file: "//content.bitsontherun.com/videos/C4lp6Dtd-640.mp4",
  width: 640,
  height: 270,
  autostart: true,
  mute: true
});
</script>

<p><em>Note that autostarting does not work on mobile phones(Android, iOS). This is a system configuration that JW Player does not have control over.</em></p>

<h2>Embed code</h2>

<p>As always, ensure you have uploaded a copy of JW Player and included the script in the &lt;head&gt; of your page, together with your player key. See an embedding guide like <a href="/customer/portal/articles/1406723-mp4-video-embed">Basic Video Embed</a> for more info. Next, place the following embed code at the location you want the player to appear:</p>

<pre>
&lt;div id=&quot;myElement&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
var playerInstance = jwplayer(&quot;myElement&quot;);
    playerInstance.setup({
      file: &quot;/uploads/myVideo.mp4&quot;,
      width: 640,
      height: 270,
      autostart: true,
      mute: true
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
