<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Download our plugins here:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://demo.jwplayer.com/wordpress/jw-player-plugin-for-wordpress-6.zip">JW Player 6 for Wordpress</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://demo.jwplayer.com/wordpress/jw-player-plugin-for-wordpress-7.zip">JW Player 7 for Wordpress BETA</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Before installing the JW Player plugin, please ensure your WordPress installation meets the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
	<li>WordPress 3.0 or higher</li>
	<li>PHP 5.0 or higher</li>
</ul>

<p>To install the plugin, extract the <a href="http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/jw-player-plugin-for-wordpress.zip">jw-player-plugin-for-wordpress.zip</a> and FTP the folder to your WordPress plugins directory (<em>/wp-content/plugins/</em>) on your web server.</p>

<p>Next, login to your WordPress website and navigate to <em>Site Admin &raquo; Plugins</em>. The JW Player Plugin will appear in the list of plugins. Click the <em>Activate</em> link to enable the plugin:</p>

<p><img alt="The JW Player Plugin Activation Menu" src="/customer/portal/attachments/229325" /></p>

<p>At this point, the plugin is ready to be used. However, if you own a <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/pricing/">commercial JW Player license</a>, you should set your Player Edition and License Key in the <em>JW Player &raquo; Settings</em> screen:</p>

<p><img alt="The JW Player WordPress License Key Settings" src="/customer/portal/attachments/229326" /></p>

<p>Setting these options will unlock the edition&#39;s additional features in both player and plugin, as well as hide the JW Player logo from the player video screen. If you are upgrading from a previous license, please make certain to select the License Version that applies to your new license type when re-entering your updated key.</p>

<h2>Embed a Video</h2>

<p>With the plugin installed and activated, it&#39;s time to embed your first video. Simply start or edit a post and hit the <em>Add Media</em> button. You will be presented with the familiar Media Manager (screenshot here is for 3.5):<img alt="The WordPress Post Editor, containing a JW Player Short Code" src="/customer/portal/attachments/229330" style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px; opacity: 0.9;" /></p>

<p>Note the JW Player plugin has added two options to the media manager: <a href="/customer/portal/articles/1403714-wordpress-plugin-reference#external">Add External Media</a> and <a href="/customer/portal/articles/1403714-wordpress-plugin-reference#playlists">Embed a Playlist</a>. Let&#39;s not jump into those now though, but instead just upload a video. If you don&#39;t have a video to upload, just <a download="bipbop" href="http://content.jwplatform.com/videos/nfSyO85Q-52qL9xLP.mp4">grab this one</a>.</p>

<h3>The Media Library</h3>

<p>When the upload is completed, you&#39;re redirected to the Media Library. The video you uploaded is selected, displaying its properties at the right side. These include a title, caption and description, but also a new <strong>Thumb</strong> property and an <strong>Embed JW Player</strong> button:<img alt="The WordPress Media Manager Upload Page" src="/customer/portal/attachments/229327" style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px; opacity: 0.9;" /></p>

<p>The <strong>Thumb</strong> property allows you to select a JPG/PNG image from the library, featuring as poster image for the video. Setting thumbs for your videos is not required, but your embeds will definitely look nicer with them.</p>

<p>The <strong>Embed JW Player</strong> button inserts a a short-code into your post, rendering your video in JW Player. The drop-down menu is used to select a <a href="/customer/portal/articles/1403714-wordpress-plugin-reference#templates">custom player template</a>. Let&#39;s stick with the default for now, so hit the <em>Embed JW Player</em> button...</p>

<h3>The Short Code</h3>

<p>The Media Manager closes, revealing the post editor again. A JW Player <em>Short Code</em> is now inserted - the snippet of text between square brackets:</p>

<p><img alt="The WordPress Media Manager Library page" src="/customer/portal/attachments/229328" style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px; opacity: 0.9;" /></p>

<p>On the public site, this short code is replaced by an actual JW Player embed, containing your video. The <em>mediaid</em> option tells JW Player which item to insert (number 22 from the library). The <a href="/customer/portal/articles/1403714-wordpress-plugin-reference#shortcodes">JW Player Short Code</a> recognizes more options (<em>width, autostart, primary..</em>) to tweak your embeds, but your basic video embed is hereby completed!</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>On certain server configurations, the plugin activation process not be successful due to your <em>wp-content/uploads</em> folder not being writable or your WordPress installation having insufficient privileges. For more information on setting file permissions please refer to <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions">this WordPress Codex entry</a>.</p>
