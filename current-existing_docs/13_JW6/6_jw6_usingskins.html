<p>This guide explains how to load existing skins into JW Player. If you are looking for information on how to design and package a skin yourself, see <a href="/customer/portal/articles/1412123-building-jw-player-skins">Building JW Player Skins</a>.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>JW Player skins change the appearance of the player, adding a custom layer to your player embeds. All visual components of the player (the controlbar, display, tooltip, dock and playlist) can be skinned. Skins are displayed on desktop and mobile browsers.</p>

<p>All paid editions of JW Player (<strong>Pro</strong>, <strong>Premium</strong> and <strong>Ads</strong>) come included with a set of 8 skins. Here you can cycle through them:</p>

<p>Several third-party vendors offer additional JW Player skins, or offer their services to create specific skins. If you are proficient with an image editor (like Photoshop), you can also build a JW Player yourself. See <a href="/customer/portal/articles/1412123-building-jw-player-skins">Building JW Player Skins</a> for more info on that.</p>

<h2>Loading a Pro Skin</h2>

<p>The skins included in the <strong>Pro/Premium/Ads</strong> editions can be configured by simply inserting the skin name. Here&#39;s an example, loading the <strong>bekle</strong> skin:</p>

<pre>
jwplayer(&quot;myElement&quot;).setup({
  file: &quot;/upload/myVideo.mp4&quot;,
  skin: &quot;bekle&quot;
});
</pre>

<p>The full list of skins (see gallery above) is: <strong>beelden</strong>, <strong>bekle</strong>, <strong>five</strong>, <strong>glow</strong>, <strong>roundster</strong>, <strong>six</strong>, <strong>stormtrooper</strong> and <strong>vapor</strong>.</p>

<p><em>Note the Pro/Premium/Ads skins are also available as a ZIP download inside your <a href="https://account.jwplayer.com">JW Player Account</a>. Use this download if you want to modify an existing skin and then host it yourself.</em></p>

<h2>Loading a Custom Skin</h2>

<p>A custom skin can be loaded by setting the <strong>skin</strong> configuration option to the URL of your skin on your webserver. Here is an example:</p>

<pre>
jwplayer(&quot;myElement&quot;).setup({
    file: &quot;/uploads/example.mp4&quot;,
    height: 360,
    image: &quot;/uploads/example.jpg&quot;,
    skin: &quot;/uploads/mySkin.xml&quot;,
    width: 640
});
</pre>

<p><em>Note that skins are subject to <a href="/customer/portal/articles/1403679-crossdomain-file-loading">Crossdomain Security Restrictions</a>, which causes issues when loading the skins from another domain than your website&#39;s.</em></p>
