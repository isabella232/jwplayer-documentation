<p>An RSS feed is a basic XML file, used to load a playlist with one or more media items into JW Player. For each entry, JW Player can read metadata, poster image, media sources and text tracks from the feed. Loading of RSS feeds differs slightly from other formats, since they use the <em>playlist</em> option instead of <em>file</em>.</p>

<p>For single video embeds, external RSS feeds are useful for larger scale media deployments, due to the separation of presentation (config options) and content (RSS feed). External RSS is also useful when working with third-party content providers, directly loading the RSS feeds off their servers (e.g. for podcasts/vodcasts).</p>

<h3>Mapping Table</h3>

<p>JW Player supports RSS feeds using the <strong>JWPlayer RSS namespace</strong> (preferred), the <a href="http://www.rssboard.org/media-rss">Media RSS namespace</a> or <a href="http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html">vanilla RSS 2.0</a> with enclosures. Not all item, source and track attributes are supported with Media RSS and plain RSS. Below is how all <a href="/customer/portal/articles/1413113-configuration-options-reference">configuration options</a> map to JWPlayer RSS, Media RSS and vanilla RSS:</p>

<p>JW Player supports playback of <a href="/customer/portal/articles/1403635-media-format-reference">multiple media formats</a>: video files, audio files, YouTube videos, RSS playlists and adaptive streams. This article explains how to embed a basic RSS feed. Here is an example, containing 5 videos:</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>An example of the player utilizing an RSS playlist can be seen below:</p>

<div id="container">&nbsp;</div>
<script>
var playerInstance = jwplayer("container");
playerInstance.setup({
playlist: "//content.jwplatform.com/feeds/13ShtP5m.rss",
displaytitle: false,
width: 640,
height: 360
});
</script>

<p>Although many playlist formats are available (e.g. ASX, ATOM, M3U, XSPF), JW Player only supports RSS. JW Player can play basic RSS feeds (using the &lt;enclosure&gt; tag), as well as RSS feeds using the MediaRSS or JW Player extensions. Services that produce compatible RSS feeds include JW Platform, iTunes, and Blip.tv.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Configuring your JW Player Library</h2>

<p>JW Player offers two options for configuring your player&#39;s library on your web page:</p>

<h3>Option A: Add a library to your &lt;head&gt;</h3>

<p>In order to embed media with JW Player, you first have to add the player library to the head of your HTML page(or elsewhere above the actual embed). Player libraries are found in your embedding wizard and will set player defaults according to what is specified in the Wizard. A player&#39;s library will appear similarly to:</p>

<pre>
&lt;script src=&quot;//content.jwplatform.com/libraries/eX4mp13.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The above library can be reached via HTTPS by changing <strong>http</strong> to <strong>https</strong> in the URL</p>

<p>JW Player libraries are cloud-hosted by us, making them fast, reliable, secure, and always up-to-date with our latest releases. In addition, all configuration is performed with our easy-to-use graphical interface via our Dashboard.</p>

<h3>Option B: Self-hosting</h3>

<p>If you want to host your own player library, you can find both your license key and latest JW Player files in your dashboard&#39;s <a href="https://dashboard.jwplayer.com/#/account/advanced">Advanced Account</a> page. Once downloaded, you will need to host jwplayer.js on your own server. When configuring your web page, you will then need to point to your copy of jwplayer.js <strong>and</strong> also define your self-hosted license key. Here&#39;s a code example:</p>

<pre>
â€‹&lt;script src=&quot;//mywebsite.com/jwplayer/jwplayer.js&quot; &gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;jwplayer.key=&quot;ABCdeFG123456SeVenABCdeFG123456SeVen==&quot;;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>JW Player 7 now <strong>requires</strong> a license key. Please make sure to include this on your page if you are self-hosting.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Create the playlist RSS Feed</h2>

<p>With the player library set up, it&#39;s time to move on to the playlist. JW Player loads external playlists using the RSS feed format. It is a basic XML format supported by many web services. You can also host these files on your own server. Here is a short example (with just one video to keep things short):</p>

<pre>
&lt;rss version=&quot;2.0&quot; xmlns:jwplayer=&quot;http://rss.jwpcdn.com/&quot;&gt;
&lt;channel&gt;

  &lt;item&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Sintel Trailer&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;Sintel is a fantasy CGI from the Blender Open Movie Project.&lt;/description&gt;
    &lt;jwplayer:image&gt;/assets/sintel.jpg&lt;/jwplayer:image&gt;
    &lt;jwplayer:source file=&quot;/assets/sintel.mp4&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/item&gt;

&lt;/channel&gt;
&lt;/rss&gt;
</pre>

<p>This RSS feed is using the <em>JWPlayer</em> extension to load media file and poster image. JW Player also supports feeds that use the <em>Media</em> extension, or vanilla feeds using enclosures. See the <a href="/customer/portal/articles/1403635-media-format-reference#feeds">Media Formats Reference</a> for more information.</p>

<p><em>Note that RSS feeds are subject to cross-domain security restrictions and therefore won&#39;t automatically load from another domain than the player. You need to setup CORS headers to fix this issue. See <a href="/customer/portal/articles/1403679-crossdomain-file-loading">Crossdomain File Loading</a> for more info.</em></p>

<h2>Step 3: Add the embed code to your &lt;body&gt;</h2>

<p>With the RSS feed ready to go, it&#39;s time to actually embed it. Therefore, insert this HTML in your page, at the exact location you want the player to appear:</p>

<pre>
&lt;div id=&quot;myElement&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
var playerInstance = jwplayer(&quot;myElement&quot;);
playerInstance.setup({
  playlist: &quot;//example.com/uploads/myPlaylist.rss&quot;,
  width: 640,
  height: 360
});
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>In this code, the &lt;div&gt; element is used as a container to load JW Player into. It must have a unique <em>id</em> attribute. The setup() block defines which <em>playlist</em> to load, as well as the <em>width</em> and <em>height</em> of the player in pixels.</p>

<p><em>Two common mistakes prevent smooth playback of videos in Internet Explorer 9+. First, always start your HTML document with <strong>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</strong> to prevent triggering IE&#39;s quirks mode. Second, serve up your videos with the <strong>video/mp4</strong> mimetype or IE will refuse to play them.</em></p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>Now that you have configured a basic player embed, you can start looking into adding further customizations. See the <a href="/customer/portal/topics/601064-customization/articles">Customization section</a> for more information.</p>
