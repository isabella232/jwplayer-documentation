<h2>Playlists</h2>

<p>While there are certain ways to link to an external <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1406722-rss-playlist-embed">RSS</a> or XML file with playlist information, it is absolutely possible to configure a playlist directly into your JW Player embed. Let&#39;s jump into a few specific examples.</p>

<h2>Creating the player</h2>

<p>Understanding how a player functions with a single item is integral to understanding how to properly create a multi-item playlst. A single item is used here:</p>

<pre>
var playerInstance = jwplayer(&quot;player&quot;);
playerInstance.setup({
  file: &#39;myvideo.mp4&#39;,
  image: &#39;myposter.png&#39;,
  title: &#39;My Video&#39;,
  mediaid: &#39;123456&#39;
});
</pre>

<h2>A single item playlist</h2>

<p>Above, we&#39;ve configured only one single item within the player with a file, poster image, and title. However, let&#39;s say that we want to create a single-item playlist. In this case, rather than specifying a file, image, and title directly, we&#39;ll be inserting these into a &quot;playlist&quot; config block as a playlist item. Let&#39;s look at the above code in the context of a playlist:</p>

<pre>
playerInstance.setup({
playlist: [{
  file: &#39;myvideo.mp4&#39;,
  image: &#39;myposter.png&#39;,
  title: &#39;My Video&#39;,
  mediaid: &#39;123456&#39;
}]
});
</pre>

<p>Again, since we&#39;re listing this as a single playlist item, both of our code snippets will behave exactly the same way. However, using the playlist block allows us to easily insert additional playlist items if needed.<br />
For reference, the formatting for a playlist is as follows:</p>

<pre>
playlist: [{}, {}, ...]
</pre>

<h2>A two-item playlist</h2>

<p>So, with the above in mind, let&#39;s add a second video item&nbsp;to our playlist:</p>

<pre>
playerInstance.setup({
playlist: [{
  file: &#39;myvideo.mp4&#39;,
  image: &#39;myposter.png&#39;,
  title: &#39;My Video&#39;,
  mediaid: &#39;123456&#39;
},
{
  file: &#39;mysecondvideo.mp4&#39;,
  image: &#39;mysecondposter.png&#39;,
  title: &#39;My Second Video&#39;,
  mediaid: &#39;234567&#39;
}]
});
</pre>

<p>Awesome! We now have two items in our playlist.</p>

<h2>A three-item playlist... and beyond</h2>

<p>Any additional playlist items will follow the same convention as above. Each item (meaning a file, image, and title) will exist within {curly} brackets, separated by a comma, and all will be fully contained within a single set of [square brackets], similar to an array. Just for clarity, three playlist items would appear as:</p>

<pre>
playerInstance.setup({
playlist: [{
  file: &#39;myvideo.mp4&#39;,
  image: &#39;myposter.png&#39;,
  title: &#39;My Video&#39;,
  mediaid: &#39;123456&#39;
},
{
  file: &#39;mysecondvideo.mp4&#39;,
  image: &#39;mysecondposter.png&#39;,
  title: &#39;My Second Video&#39;,
  mediaid: &#39;234567&#39;
},
{
  file: &#39;mythirdvideo.mp4&#39;,
  image: &#39;mythirdposter.png&#39;,
  title: &#39;My Third Video&#39;,
  mediaid: &#39;345678&#39;
}]
});
</pre>

<p>Any configuration options after a playlist will still require a comma after the second square bracket similar to:</p>

<pre>
playerInstance.setup({
playlist: [{
  file: &#39;myvideo.mp4&#39;,
  image: &#39;myposter.png&#39;,
  title: &#39;My Video&#39;,
  mediaid: &#39;123456&#39;
},
{
  file: &#39;mysecondvideo.mp4&#39;,
  image: &#39;mysecondposter.png&#39;,
  title: &#39;My Second Video&#39;,
  mediaid: &#39;234567&#39;
},
{
  file: &#39;mythirdvideo.mp4&#39;,
  image: &#39;mythirdposter.png&#39;,
  title: &#39;My Third Video&#39;,
  mediaid: &#39;345678&#39;
}],
primary: &#39;flash&#39;
});
</pre>

<p>So again, this is still allowed, just keep the additional comma in mind when embedding!</p>

<h2>Sources with a playlist</h2>

<p>Lasty, it is entirely possible to create a playlist item that has multiple sources (Either using multiple qualities or fallbacks) in conjunction with our article <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1710454-configuring-multiple-sources">here</a>. You&#39;ll need to nest your sources block in place of&nbsp;&quot;file&quot;&nbsp;within the playlist item. So a quick example of the structure would look like:</p>

<pre>
playerInstance.setup({
    playlist: [{
        sources: [{source1},{source2},{source3}, ...],
        image: &#39;myposter.png&#39;,
        title: &#39;My Video&#39;,
        mediaid: &#39;123456&#39;
},{
        sources: [{source1},{source2},{source3}, ...],
        image: &#39;mysecondposter.png&#39;,
        title: &#39;My Second Video&#39;,
        mediaid: &#39;234567&#39;
},{
        sources: [{source1},{source2},{source3}, ...],
        image: &#39;mythirdposter.png&#39;,
        title: &#39;My Third Video&#39;,
        mediaid: &#39;345678&#39;
}],
});
</pre>

<p>An actual example of this would look like with 3 different sources per playlist item is shown here:</p>

<pre>
playerInstance.setup({
playlist: [{
     sources: [{ 
            file: &quot;myFile.flv&quot;
        },{ 
            file: &quot;myFile.mp4&quot;
        },{
            file: &quot;myFile.webm&quot;
        }],
     image: &#39;image.jpg&#39;,
     title: &#39;This is a multisource video!&#39;,
     mediaid: &#39;123456&#39;
},{
     sources: [{ 
            file: &quot;myFile2.flv&quot;
        },{ 
            file: &quot;myFile2.mp4&quot;
        },{
            file: &quot;myFile2.webm&quot;
        }],
     image: &#39;image2.jpg&#39;,
     title: &#39;This is another multisource video!&#39;,
     mediaid: &#39;234567&#39;
},{
     sources: [{ 
            file: &quot;myFile3.flv&quot;
        },{ 
            file: &quot;myFile3.mp4&quot;
        },{
            file: &quot;myFile3.webm&quot;
        }],
     image: &#39;image3.jpg&#39;,
     title: &#39;This the final multisource video!&#39;,
     mediaid: &#39;345678&#39;
}]
});
</pre>
