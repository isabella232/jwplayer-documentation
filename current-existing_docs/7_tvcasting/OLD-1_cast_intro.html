<div class="article_warning"><strong>Important note: Casting is available as of JW Player 7.0.2.&nbsp;</strong></div>

<p>JW Player is <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/products/jwplayer/chromecast/" target="_blank">Google Cast</a> Ready in JW7&nbsp;for <strong>Premium and higher users</strong>. This document will cover the functionality currently available and will walk through how to set up a JW Player to be Google Cast-Ready so your viewers can start enjoying content on their big screen! Note that you must be on <strong>JW Player 7.0.2</strong>&nbsp;to cast HLS content.</p>

<div class="article_callout">This document applies to users of <strong>JW Player Premium</strong>. Don&#39;t have Premium? <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/pricing/">Upgrade Now</a>.</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Cast functionality will allow your videos to be cast from a Chrome browser via the Chromecast plugin directly to a JW Player receiver app on a Chromecast-connected TV. Once the JW Player detects a Chromecast on the network, a Cast icon appears in the control bar to let viewers know they can display their content on a TV. The JW Player within the browser becomes a remote control for viewing media on a TV screen. Here is a short video demonstrating the process:</p>

<div id="container1" style="margin-left:40px; box-shadow:0 0 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.5);">&nbsp;</div>
<script type="text/javascript">
var playerInstance = jwplayer("container1");
playerInstance.setup({
  file: "http://content.jwplatform.com/videos/bYWNZmV9-1280.mp4",
  image: "http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/bYWNZmV9-1280.jpg",
  width: 640,
  height: 360
});
</script>

<p>As you can see in above demonstration, video advertising through VAST is included.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Basic Definitions</h3>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Sender -</strong> A Cast enabled JW Player running inside of a Chrome browser. The JW Player requires a sender App ID.</li>
	<li><strong>Receiver -</strong> A JW Player receiver application that runs on the Chromecast device. The receiver application performs the following functions:
	<ul>
		<li>Provides an interface to display the app&#39;s content on the TV.</li>
		<li>Handles messages from the sender application to control content on the receiver device.</li>
		<li>Handles custom messages from the sender application that are application-specific (VAST advertising messages and eventually JW Player API support)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Supported Media Formats</h2>

<p>The following media formats are supported in the JW Player Chromecast implementation:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Video - </strong>mp4, WebM</li>
	<li><strong>Audio - </strong>aac, mp3</li>
	<li><strong>Audio/Video Streaming - </strong>M3U8</li>
</ul>

<p>The following media formats are <strong>not</strong> supported in JW Player&rsquo;s Chromecast implementation:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>RTMP - </strong>Will not be supported due to requirement of Adobe Flash. HLS should be used instead.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Registering with Google Cast</h2>

<p>In order to use Chromecast on the JW Player you must first register your receiver application with Google. This process takes about 15 minutes to complete. You will be using the JW Player as your receiver application. Please contact <a href="mailto:support@jwplayer.com?subject=Chromecast%20Receiver%20URL%20Request">support@jwplayer.com</a> to obtain the url for the receiver application.</p>

<h3><strong>Steps</strong></h3>

<ol>
	<li>Read over the registration process <a href="https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/registration" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
	<li>Create a <a href="https://cast.google.com/publish/#/signup" target="_blank">Google Cast SDK Developer Account</a> and be sure to read the TOS and Privacy Policy.</li>
	<li>Sign into the Developer Console.</li>
	<li>Add a New Application.</li>
	<li>Select &ldquo;Custom Receiver.&rdquo;</li>
	<li>Fill in the form for New Custom Receiver.
	<ul>
		<li>Name: Your Brand Name.</li>
		<li>URL: The Receiver URL you need is provided in the Casting section of the Player builder in your dashboard, which you will see when either creating&nbsp;a new player or editing an existing one.&nbsp;If you do not see your Receiver URL, please e-mail us at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:support@jwplayer.com?subject=Chromecast%20Receiver%20URL%20location">support@jwplayer.com</a>.</li>
		<li>Platform: Select Chrome.</li>
		<li>Icon: Upload a 512x512 icon of your brand logo.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Publish your application.</li>
</ol>

<p>After your application is published you will receive an Application ID. This takes between five and ten minutes. The ID is used to authenticate with Google that you have signed the terms of service for using Chromecast with your content and turns the Chromecast functionality on in the JW Player.<br />
Additional registration steps can be found on Google&#39;s developer site <a href="https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/registration" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
