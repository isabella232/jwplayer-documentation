<body>
<p>Certain legacy <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/products/jwplatform/" target="_blank"><strong>JW Platform</strong></a> accounts use a <a href="http://dashboard.jwplatform.com/payments/paygo/">pay-as-you-go pricing model</a> for account balances. The article below explains how to refill&nbsp;your plan&#39;s balances to ensure that your account stays active and functional.</p>

<h2><strong>Important Note</strong></h2>

<p><strong>This method of payment is for JW Platform&nbsp;Legacy customers. We no longer offer this payment model. </strong></p>

<h2><a name="two-balances"></a>Two Balances</h2>

<p>JW Platform tracks two balances that together cover your usage of the video platform:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Platform Usage Balance</dt>
	<dd>Platform usage charges cover the cost of using the JW platform, including: video upload, transcoding, storage, content &amp; playlist management, API usage and player configuration.<br />
	The charges for platform usage are based on the size of your video library over time. This is tracked in terms of GB-month. You purchase GB-months, which are then consumed by your use of the video platform.</dd>
	<dt>Video Delivery Balance</dt>
	<dd>Video delivery charges cover the cost of embedding video players, streaming or downloading your content, securing your content and tracking video analytics.<br />
	The charges for video delivery are based on the amount of video data transferred in Gigabytes (GB). You can purchase any amount of video delivery you like, which is then consumed as your users watch your videos.</dd>
</dl>

<h2><a name="rate-cards"></a>Rate Cards</h2>

<p>When adding funds to your account, the amount you buy determines the rate - larger amounts are cheaper. Our rate cards are placed below. <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/contact-us/enterprise/">Please contact us</a> if you are looking for custom rates.</p>

<h2><a name="tracking-usage"></a>Tracking Usage</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://dashboard.jwplatform.com">JW Platform Dashboard</a> displays both your platform usage and video delivery balance. You will also receive notification emails if one of your balances is running low. You can replenish your account at any time. You must maintain positive balances in order for your account to remain active.</p>

<ul>
	<li>If your video delivery balance reaches zero, we temporarily suspend your video streaming. Your videos will still be safely stored in your account, but you must recharge your video delivery balance in order to resume streaming.</li>
	<li>If your platform usage balance reaches zero, we suspend your ability to upload new videos. At this point, you must recharge your platform usage balance in order to prevent your account from being closed after 30 days.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="making-purchases"></a>Making Purchases</h2>

<p>JW Platform accepts the following payment methods:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Paypal</strong>, which allows for secure payments by bank or by credit card. After the checkout, your platform usage and video delivery are instantly updated and reflected in your account.</li>
	<li><strong>Credit Cards</strong>, for USD orders only. After the checkout, your platform usage and video delivery are instantly updated and reflected in your account.</li>
	<li><strong>Bank transfers</strong>, whereby we hand you the invoice after checkout. You yourself have to transfer the funds to our bank account. When the money lands, your platform usage/video delivery are updated.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are unable to use direct payments (for instance if you work with purchase orders), you can contact our sales team for more information. Note that it is already possible to put a custom reference on our invoices, through the <em>Your Reference</em> input in the checkout screen.</p>

<h2><a name="update-delays"></a>Update Delays</h2>

<p>Depending on your method of payment it sometimes takes a day or more for us to receive it. In these cases your account is updated as soon as we receive the payment. The speed of payment processing depends on chosen payment method:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A payment with <strong>PayPal</strong> is usually instant, but in some cases can still take a little longer for Paypal to approve your payment. There are always delays if you use an e-check with PayPal. PayPal holds the payment until the e-check has cleared. As soon as this happens PayPal sends us a message and we immediately update your account.</li>
	<li>A payment by <strong>Credit Card</strong> is always instant.</li>
	<li>A payment by <strong>Bank Transfer</strong> will not be processed until the money has been transferred from your bank and received by our bank. With international transfers it can take a few days or in rare cases more than a week. We check our account every weekday to see which payments we receive.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please <a href="http://dashboard.jwplatform.com/">contact us</a> if you think your payment should already have been processed. Please include all relevant information, such as your JW Platform invoice and PayPal transaction ID.</p>
