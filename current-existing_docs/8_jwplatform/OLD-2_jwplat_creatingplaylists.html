<p>This article introduces the playlist management capabilities of <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/products/jwplatform/" target="_blank">JW Platform</a>. These can be found in the <em>Playlists</em> section of the dashboard:</p>

<h2>Creating Playlist</h2>

<p>Hit the big <em>Create New Playlist</em> button to popup the playlist overlay. In this, set a title for your playlist and the type op playlist you want to create:</p>

<p><img alt="playlists creation overlay" src="/customer/portal/attachments/257235" /></p>

<p>The two types of playlists behave differently, so make sure you understand their details:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Manual</strong> playlists are populated by hand. You literally drag &amp; drop videos into the playlist, just like you would with a tool like iTunes or Winamp. Manual playlists won&#39;t automatically get updated.</li>
	<li><strong>Dynamic</strong> playlists are automatically populated based upon rules. For example, you can create a playlist that has <em>All videos that are tagged with <strong>Cat</strong></em>. Every time you tag a new video with <strong>Cat</strong>, it will automatically get added to that playlist.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: make sure you have a couple of videos in your account already, otherwise there&#39;s no content to put inside your playlist.</p>

<h2>Managing Playlists</h2>

<p>Once a playlist is created, you can jump to the properties page of that playlist. Here is a screenshot of the properties of a <em>dynamic</em> playlist (<em>manual</em> playlist properties are very similar):</p>

<p><img alt="playlists properties page" src="/customer/portal/attachments/257237" /></p>

<p>On this page, you can manage all aspects of this playlist, including:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Updating the metadata of the playlist, like its <em>title</em> and <em>description</em>.</li>
	<li>For <strong>Dynamic</strong> playlists: Updating the rules for populating the playlist, like the tags to use, the sorting method and the maximum length.</li>
	<li>For <strong>Manual</strong> playlists: Searching and adding new videos by dragging them from the search results.</li>
	<li>Viewing the current lineup of the playlist. For <strong>Dynamic</strong> playlist, this is purely informational. For <strong>Manual</strong> playlists, you can also re-order or delete videos here.</li>
</ol>

<p>The right sidebar of the page contains the options for publishing the playlist to your audience.</p>

<h2>Publishing Playlists</h2>

<p>There are two ways to publish playlists from JW Platform. The most important and widely used one is by publishing it in JW Player. Do this by hitting the <em>Embed This Playlist</em> button. It will popup the publishing overlay:</p>

<p><img alt="playlists publishing overlay" src="/customer/portal/attachments/257238" /></p>

<p>Here, select which player design you want to use to publish your playlist. Next, copy/paste the resulting embed code into your own website or blog. A preview of your video+playlist is shown below the code.</p>

<p>Use the small links at the bottom to quickly publish the playlist to Facebook, to Twitter, or to Email in a preview page.</p>
<a name="rss"></a>

<h3>RSS Feed</h3>

<p>The other way to publish playlists is through RSS Feeds. This method is valuable for syndication of your video content to partners that have their own video player. The RSS feed contains all the metadata and media links they need to play your videos.</p>

<p>RSS Feeds are also useful for syndicating your content to podcasting services like iTunes. Our feeds are standard RSS and compliant with many of them.</p>
<a name="json"></a>

<h3>JSON Feed</h3>

<p>The latest addition to JW Platform allows for a user to receive a JSON feed of a particular video or playlist object. Compared to existing RSS feeds, JSON feeds allow for information related to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Available Transcodes</li>
	<li>Transcode labels</li>
	<li>Media dimensions</li>
	<li>Video type</li>
	<li>Content Duration</li>
	<li>Passthrough files</li>
	<li>Available Caption/Thumbnail Tracks</li>
</ul>

<p>With the above information, JW Platform&#39;s JSON feeds can be used to verify the completion/quantity of transcodes, as well as to populate meta information for social media sites like Facebook or Twitter. Previously, this information was only accessible via JW Platform&#39;s API, but it can now be pinged on a production site, which does not apply to JW Platform&#39;s 10 API calls/minute limit.</p>
