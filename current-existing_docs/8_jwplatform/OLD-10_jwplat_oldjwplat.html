<p>This guide explains how analytics function within <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/products/jwplatform/" target="_blank">JW Platform</a> and will help clarify the terms and ideas behind their use. Please note that JW Platform analytics differ from JW Player analytics in both form and function.</p>

<div class="article_callout">This document applies to users of <strong>JW Platform</strong>. Don&#39;t have Hosting? <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/pricing/">Upgrade Now</a>.</div>

<p>Analytics for your JW Platform content can be accessed by selecting the &lsquo;Analytics&rsquo; section at the top of your dashboard or by visiting your <a href="http://dashboard.jwplatform.com/analytics" target="_blank">analytics page</a> directly. Here, you&rsquo;ll be shown an aggregate view of your content for a selected date range.</p>

<h2><strong>Aggregate video metrics view</strong></h2>

<p>​This section gives a general high level view of views across all videos over a given period. For more information about particular videos, please see the <strong>video object metrics view</strong> below.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Media analytics overview</strong></h3>

<p>At the top of your analytics page, we display an overview of metrics for a selected date period.<br />
<img alt="" src="/customer/portal/attachments/340691" style="width: 627px; height: 201px;" /><br />
<br />
<strong>Views -</strong> Views are counted whenever a video object is either downloaded or streamed. In the event of an MP4 fallback being played(or downloaded directly), this constitutes a download. Conversely, the use of RTMP or HLS for this video object is counted as a stream.<br />
<strong>Pageviews -</strong> A pageview occurs when an embedded player gets loaded on a web page, regardless if a file is actually loaded/played.<br />
<strong>Minutes Viewed -</strong> The combined amount of time that your videos have been viewed over your chosen period. For example, if a one minute video has been viewed 5,000 times, we would display 5,000 minutes here.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Analytics by day</strong></h3>

<p><img alt="" src="/customer/portal/attachments/340693" style="width: 624px; height: 226px;" /> Here, we&rsquo;re able to see a timeline of which days our videos have been at their highest popularity. Mousing over these data points will provide additional information, including the specific date, and the designated metric. For example, in our above graph, we can see that there were 121 content views on May 7th. Changing tabs to &ldquo;Pageviews&rdquo; and &ldquo;Time Viewed&rdquo; will display the appropriate metric.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Analytics by video</strong></h3>

<p><img alt="" src="/customer/portal/attachments/340694" style="width: 611px; height: 244px;" /> Further down the page, we see &ldquo;Analytics by video&rdquo;. This is the same information as above, now broken between separate video objects. By clicking on any of the categories here (Videos, Views, Pageviews, and Time Viewed) we can sort our content based on these metrics. By default, this is sorted by &ldquo;Views&rdquo;. We can get additional details related to a particular video object by selecting it.<br />
<strong>Notice regarding playlists: We will only count a pageview for a particular video when it is loaded exclusively within a player. If a video object is being utilized within a playlist, the loading of this playlist will not constitute as a &ldquo;Pageview&rdquo;.</strong></p>
​

<h2><strong>Video object metrics view</strong></h2>

<p>Selecting a video object navigates a user to a video-centric analytics view. We now see views, pageviews, and plays for a particular video, rather than a combined view for all of our content. Please note that all metrics definitions from our aggregate view are still relevant here.<br />
<br />

​<strong>Engagement data​</strong></p>

<p>In this section, we can watch our video object with an accompanying engagement graph. As our video progresses, we see a display of the most/least viewed sections. For example, an exciting action scene at the end of a file may spike engagement in the last 75% of the timeline. An uneventful portion of a video may be viewed less.p</p>
