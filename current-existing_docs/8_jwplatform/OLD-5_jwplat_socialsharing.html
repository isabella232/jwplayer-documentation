<p>Sharing of videos through Facebook, Twitter, blogs and email can dramatically increase reach across the web. See <a href="http://www.longtailvideo.com/support/blog/22445/social-sharing-publish-your-videos-to-facebook-twitter-youtube">this blog post on sharing</a> for more info and some hints.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/products/jwplatform/" target="_blank">JW Platform</a> contains point &amp; click social sharing functionality. This includes functionality playback of your videos inside the Facebook wall and Twitter cards. This document explains what the various options are, and what works best in a situation.</p>

<h2>Sharing Setup</h2>

<p>Getting started is quite easy. Simply go to the <a href="http://dashboard.bitsontherun.com/players/">dashboard &quot;players&quot; tab</a> and click on a player to edit it. In the <em>general</em> section of the player properties you will find the <em>Sharing</em> dropdown selector:</p>

<p>When sharing is enabled, an icon appears in the top-left corner of the player. This icon can be used by your viewers to bring up the social sharing overlay.</p>

<h2>Sharing Overlay</h2>

<p>The Social Sharing overlay for JW Player contains several options to share a video:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Share with Facebook. The video will play inside the Facebook wall.</li>
	<li>Share with Twitter. The video will play inside the Twitter feed.</li>
	<li>Share with email. This will popup a new email with a link to the video.</li>
	<li>Copy/paste the <strong>video link</strong> to share using any other service.</li>
	<li>Copy/paste the <strong>embed code</strong> to embed the video in blogs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Facebook &amp; Twitter</h2>

<p>Videos shared with Facebook &amp; Twitter will play inside the Facebook wall and Twitter feed, minimizing friction and maximizing playback. Here is an example of how your video will look inside the Facebook wall:</p>

<p>Technically, playback is enabled through the <em>Facebook OpenGraph</em> and <em>Twitter Cards</em> headers we place inside a video&#39;s <a href="http://content.jwplatform.com/players/HkauGhRi.html">iframe embed page</a>. No configuration is needed on your website</p>
