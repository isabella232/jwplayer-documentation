<div class="article_callout">This article applies to all users <strong>except JW Platform</strong> users.</div>

<p><span>Your&nbsp;JW Player Dashboard comes complete with an analytics section, where you can monitor your content performance, and look at activity by device, geography, engagement, and more.&nbsp;Player activity is associated&nbsp;with a unique&nbsp;media ID, to ensure&nbsp;that everything is attributed accurately. <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/2083166-using-media-ids" target="_blank">Click here</a> to learn more about Media IDs.</span></p>

<h2 id="how-to-apply-media-IDs"><br />
<span>How to Ensure Data Capture</span></h2>

<p><em>Note: If you already use the dashboard to add content and generate embed code, your setup work is already done.</em></p>

<ol>
	<li>Get Media IDs for your content via the <strong>Dashboard</strong> or the <strong>API </strong>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Dashboard:</strong> Add externally-hosted URLs or upload your content via the dashboard, and find the Media ID on each piece of content&rsquo;s detail page

		<ul>
			<li><em>Go to your Content section, and select &ldquo;upload&rdquo; or &ldquo;add via URL&rdquo; on the big action button on the top left</em></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>API:</strong> The <a href="http://apidocs.jwplayer.com/methods/videos/create.html" target="_blank">/videos/create method</a> supports externally-hosted URLs</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<br />
	<li>Embed all content using Media IDs
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Dashboard:</strong> Once your content is added, click &ldquo;embed&rdquo; on a video from the detail page or list page. (Publish Mode generates single-line embed codes that contain a reference to your content&rsquo;s Media ID.)</li>
		<li><strong>API:</strong> Include the Media ID parameter in your player embeds, as in the below code example:
		<pre>
playlist:[{
file:&quot;&quot;,
mediaid:&quot;eXaMPlE1&quot;
}]</pre>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>
