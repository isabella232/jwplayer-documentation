<body>
<p>Here is an example of a setup of JW Player that autostarts the video - but only for the first time a user visits the page:</p>

<div id="container">&nbsp;</div>
<script>
var playerInstance = jwplayer("container");
playerInstance.setup({
  image: "//content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/bkaovAYt-640.jpg",
  file: "//content.jwplatform.com/videos/bkaovAYt-kNspJqnJ.mp4"
});

playerInstance.on('ready', function(){
  if(document.cookie.indexOf("jwplayerAutoStart") == -1) {
    document.cookie = "jwplayerAutoStart=1";
    playerInstance.play();
  }
});
</script>â€‹

<p>This feature is built using the <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1413089-javascript-api-reference">JW Player JavaScript API</a>, with just a few lines of JavaScript code.</p>

<h3>Embed code</h3>

<p>Assuming that you have a functional JW Player setup as mentioned <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1406723-mp4-video-embed">here</a>, you&#39;ll need to add the following code to your page:</p>

<pre>
&lt;script&gt;
  if(document.cookie.indexOf(&quot;jwplayerAutoStart&quot;) == -1) {
    document.cookie = &quot;jwplayerAutoStart=1&quot;;
    playerInstance.play();
  }
&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

<p>This script uses a cookie to store that a viewer was autostarted before. If that&#39;s not the case, the playerInstance.play() function is called. However, please be aware that autostart does not work on mobile devices.</p>
