<p>This article will explain where to find your license keys &amp; player downloads in your JW Player Account dashboard.</p>
<p>Navigate to the <a href="https://dashboard.jwplayer.com/#/players/list">Players section</a> of your Account dashboard. On the left-hand side of the Players list, click the link that says, "<a href="https://dashboard.jwplayer.com/#/players/downloads">License Keys &amp; Downloads</a>". </p>
<p>[screenshot of players list page] </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On this page, you'll find your player &amp; SDK downloads (if applicable) in the "Downloads" table, and the blue button to download at the far right. You'll also see your Player &amp; SDK license keys in this table, which you can copy quickly and be on your way.</p>
<p>This table will also allow you to note which version of the player or SDKs you are downloading, as well as the date of the last time we updated the downloads in this page.</p>

<h2>Cloud Player Over Self-Hosted Player </h2>
<p>Did you know that our cloud player libraries can do everything that the self-hosted player can do? Plus, you'll have the added bonus of automatic player updates &mdash; we'll stay on top of changes in browser technology and bug fixes, so you don't have to.</p>
<p>To grab a cloud-hosted player library URL, simply use the dropdown available on this downloads page to select a player and copy the URL. </p>

<p>You can also grab a player's library code any time you are editing a player in the dashboard, on the Player Detail page.</p>
