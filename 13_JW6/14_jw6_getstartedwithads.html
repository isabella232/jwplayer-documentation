<p>This article will go step-by-step over how to set up your new JW Player Ads subscription. From the use of your key, to the implementation of the ad tag itself.</p>

<div class="article_callout">This document applies to users of <strong>JW Player Advertising</strong>. Don&#39;t have Advertising? <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/pricing/">Upgrade Now</a>.</div>

<h2>Step 1: Getting your key and player</h2>

<p>The first thing you&#39;ll need to do, is log into your new JW Player account. The login page can be found <a href="https://account.jwplayer.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br />
Upon logging in, you will need to visit your <a href="https://account.jwplayer.com/#/account" target="_blank">account page</a>. Here, you&#39;ll see two generated items. There is the cloud-hosted player code, and the self-hosted key.<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="/customer/portal/attachments/239376" style="width: 586px; height: 175px;" /></p>

<p>Please note that these two items are different and use different keys. Your cloud-hosted token is what you&#39;ll use if you choose to host your JW Player with us. If you choose to self-host, the Self-hosted player license key will need to be used in conjunction with the downloaded player here:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" src="/customer/portal/attachments/239380" style="width: 254px; height: 50px;" /><br />
<br />
This will download a zip of all required files.<br />
<br />
<strong>A note on trial keys:</strong> If you have been given a temporary trial key by one of our sales representatives, this trial key will be used in place of your self-hosted key.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Getting your player embedded</h2>

<p>For a standard embed, there are three portions to have set up:</p>

<p><strong>1 - The Javascript Embed -</strong> This portion of the embed is what associates the&nbsp;JW&nbsp;Player&nbsp;with the page you&#39;re working with. Depending on if the self-hosted or cloud-hosted is utilized, this portion of your code is all that will need to be changed.<br />
<strong>2 - The div&nbsp;-</strong> This portion controls where your player appears on your page.<br />
<strong>3 - The player embed -</strong> This portion references the aforementioned div and will control how your player appears. Your player setup options live here and will control what videos play, what ads are used, the size of the player, and many other items. We have a full list of configurable options <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1413113-configuration-options-referenceedding-the-player" target="_blank">here</a>.Let&#39;s take a look at an example of each of these items!</p>

<h3><strong>1 - The Javascript Embed</strong></h3>

<p>This portion exists in the head of your page. As mentioned, there are two ways to do this. For the cloud-hosted player, your script will contain your player key, so there will only need to be one single line of code.</p>

<h3>Cloud-Hosted Embed</h3>

<pre>
&lt;script src=&quot;http://jwpsrv.com/library/eeefffGGGhhh111jjj123.js&quot; &gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

<p>For a self-hosted player, you will be the one hosting the files needed for this. As such, you&#39;ll need to use your self-hosted key from part 1. Assuming you were hosting your files in a folder called &quot;jwplayer&quot;, your self-hosted embed might look something like this:</p>

<h3>Self-Hosted Embed</h3>

<pre>
&lt;script src=&quot;/jwplayer/jwplayer.js&quot; &gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;jwplayer.key=&quot;ABCdeFG123456SeVenABCdeFG123456SeVen==&quot;;&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

<p>Once this portion is done, we&#39;ll move on to step 2!</p>

<h3><strong>2 - The div</strong></h3>

<p>This is a pretty easy portion. Here, we just determine where on the page we want our player to appear. You&#39;ll need to set up a &lt;div&gt; element and choose its name. In this example, we&#39;ll set up a div element and call it &quot;myElement&quot;. Any text we put in between the div will show up in the event that there&#39;s an error loading our player. In this case, we&#39;ll put in the text &quot;Player load error!&quot;.</p>

<pre>
&lt;div id=&#39;myElement&#39;&gt;Player load error!&lt;/div&gt;</pre>

<h3><strong>3 - The Player&nbsp;Embed</strong></h3>

<p>This is where we actually configure the player&#39;s options. For this example, we&#39;ll set up a player with a single video, a poster preview, and a preroll ad tag.<br />
<br />
Let&#39;s take a look at the code we&#39;ll be using here. We can then break it down to each individual portion to see what&#39;s happening here.</p>

<pre>
​jwplayer(&#39;myElement&#39;).setup({
  file: &#39;assets/myVideo.mp4&#39;,
  image: &#39;images/myImage.jpg&#39;,
  primary: &#39;flash&#39;,
  advertising: {
    client: &#39;vast&#39;,
    tag: &#39;http://adserver.com/vastResponse.xml&#39;
  }
});</pre>

<p>Let&#39;s start from&nbsp;the top!</p>

<pre>
​jwplayer(&#39;myElement&#39;).setup({</pre>

<p>​This portion of our code is invoking the setup of our player. Notice the &#39;myElement&#39; portion here. This is the section that defines which div element we&#39;re going to generate our player in.</p>

<pre>
file: &#39;assets/myVideo.mp4&#39;,</pre>

<p>The file portion of our embed references the video we wish to play. Here, the player will be looking for an mp4 file called &#39;myVideo&#39; in the assets folder. This will change depending on how/where you&#39;re loading your content from.</p>

<pre>
​image: &#39;images/myImage.jpg&#39;,</pre>

<p>Here is where we load our poster image. This is the image file that will appear before our video loads.&nbsp;Again, we&#39;re referencing a jpeg file called myImage in the images folder.</p>

<pre>
primary: &#39;flash&#39;,</pre>

<p>By default, our player will attempt to load in HTML5 initially. With ads, we suggest trying to load in Flash first. Certain ad types (VPAID) require the use of flash, so this is always a preferred method of loading things. Note that this will <strong>not</strong> disable HTML5 mode, it will simply attempt to use HTML5 as a backup, instead of as a primary. In the case of iOS or Android devices which do not have flash, nothing will change with the player, since they can only load HTML5.</p>

<pre>
​ advertising: {
    client: &#39;vast&#39;,
    tag: &#39;http://adserver.com/vastResponse.xml&#39;
  }</pre>

<p>Here is where we set up our advertising. Since there are multiple advertising options, we try to contain these individual pieces within a &quot;block&quot;. Notice that all of these advertising options are contained within an additional set of braces and designated with the &quot;advertising&quot; label.</p>

<pre>
client: &#39;vast&#39;,</pre>

<p>Here, we specify the type of ad client used. Unless you are using Google&#39;s DFP, vast should be used here. You can usually tell you&#39;re using&nbsp;a Google DFP ad&nbsp;if your tag begins with &quot;pubads.g.doubleclick.net&quot;. In this case, &#39;vast&#39;&nbsp;will need to be changed to &#39;googima&#39;.</p>

<pre>
tag: &#39;http://adserver.com/vastResponse.xml&#39;</pre>

<p>Here is where we specify our ad tag. This should be given to you by your ads provider.</p>

<pre>
​});</pre>

<p>And we have now closed out our JW Player embed.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Testing it out!</h2>

<p>With all of the elements in place, you should now be able to test your page. Either utilizing a localhost setup, or a live web server, load your page up and see if the player appears. If you&#39;re seeing the text we&#39;ve used above between our div (Player load error!), there was possibly a problem with your script or embed. Make sure all files are being referenced correctly. Also, it&#39;s important to add or subtract commas as needed. For each embed option, a comma must be used if there is another following it. For example:</p>

<pre>
client: &#39;vast&#39;,</pre>

<p>has a comma since it is followed by</p>

<pre>
tag: &#39;http://adserver.com/vastResponse.xml&#39;</pre>

<p>Notice that the tag portion does not use a comma afterwards since it is the last item in the embed.</p>
