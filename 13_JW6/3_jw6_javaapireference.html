<h2><a name="setup"></a>Setup</h2>

<p>These API calls are used to setup players and learn when and with which technology players are instantiated.</p>

<dl style="clear:none">
	<dt>getRenderingMode()</dt>
	<dd>Returns the rendering mode in which the player is setup. Can be <strong>flash</strong> or <strong>html5</strong>.</dd>
</dl>

<dl style="clear:none">
	<dt>setup(<em>options</em>)</dt>
	<dd>Setup a new JW Player. The <em>options</em> parameter is required and in the form of an Object. The options block in turn always needs a <em>file</em> property. Without a file to play, JW Player instances cannot be setup. See the <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1413113-configuration-options-reference" target="_blank">Configuration Options Reference</a> for a list of all JW Player configuration options.</dd>
	<dt>remove()</dt>
	<dd>Being the reverse of the setup() call, this call will remove a JW Player from the page. It ensures the player stops playback, the DOM is re-set to its original state and all event listeners and timers are cleaned up.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
	<dt>onReady(<em>callback</em>)</dt>
	<dd>Fired when the player has initialized in either Flash or HTML5 and is ready for playback. Has no attributes.</dd>
	<dt>onSetupError(<em>callback</em>)</dt>
	<dd>Fired when neither the Flash nor HTML5 player could be setup. Event attributes:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>fallback</strong> (Boolean): This is set <strong>true</strong> when a <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1403653-browser-device-reference" target="_blank">download fallback</a> is rendered instead of just an error message.</li>
		<li><strong>message</strong> (String): The error message that describes why the player could not be setup</li>
	</ul>
	</dd>
</dl>

<hr />
<h2><a name="playlist"></a>Playlist</h2>

<p>These API calls are used for loading and retrieving the current playlist (of one or more items), as well as for navigating between playlist items.</p>

<p>The data model of a playlists is as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <em>playlist</em> is an Array, containing one or more playlist items.</li>
	<li>Each <em>item</em> is an Object, containing the <em>title</em> (String), <em>description</em> (String), <em>mediaid</em> (String), <em>image</em> (String), <em>sources</em> (Array) and <em>tracks</em> (Array) properties.</li>
	<li>The <em>sources</em> Array in turn contain a list of Objects, each with a <em>file</em>, <em>type</em>, <em>label</em> and <em>default</em> property.</li>
	<li>The <em>tracks</em> Array in turn contain a list of Objects, each with a <em>file</em>, <em>kind</em> and <em>default</em> property.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, each playlist item has a <em>file</em> property, which acts as a shortcut to the <em>file</em> of the first entry in the <em>sources</em> Array. This shortcut makes it easier to do basic playlist loading or fetching, since most publishers will setup their playlist items with one file only.</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1413113-configuration-options-reference" target="_blank">Configurations Options Reference</a> for a description of each property and some example playlists.</p>

<dl>
	<dt>getPlaylist()</dt>
	<dd>Returns the player&#39;s current playlist array.</dd>
	<dt>getPlaylistIndex()</dt>
	<dd>Returns the <em>index</em> of the currently active item in the playlist.</dd>
	<dt>getPlaylistItem(<em>index</em>)</dt>
	<dd>Returns the playlist item object at the specified index. If the index is not specified, the currently playing playlistItem is returned.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
	<dt>load(<em>playlist</em>)</dt>
	<dd>Loads a new playlist into the player. The <em>playlist</em> parameter is required and can be either:
	<ul>
		<li>An <strong>Array</strong>, containing playlist items.</li>
		<li>A <string>string</string>, pointing to the location of an RSS feed.</li>
	</ul>
	For example, here&#39;s a simple call that loads a playlist with one item, with one source:

	<pre>
jwplayer().load([{file:&quot;/assets/myVideo.mp4&quot;}]);</pre>
	</dd>
	<dt>playlistItem(<em>index</em>)</dt>
	<dd>Start playback of the playlist item at the specified index.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
	<dt>onPlaylist(<em>callback</em>)</dt>
	<dd>Fired when a new playlist has been loaded into the player. Note this event is not fired as part of the initial playlist load (playlist is loaded when <strong>onReady</strong> is called). Event attributes:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>playlist</strong> (Array): The new playlist; an array of playlist items.</li>
	</ul>
	</dd>
	<dt>onPlaylistItem(<em>callback</em>)</dt>
	<dd>Fired when the playlist index changes to a new playlist item. This event occurs before the player begins playing the new playlist item. Event attributes:
	<ul>

		<li><strong>playlist</strong> (Array): The new playlist; an array of playlist items.</li>
	</ul>
	</dd>
	<dt>onPlaylistComplete(<em>callback</em>)</dt>
	<dd>Fired when the player is done playing all items in the playlist. However, if the <strong>repeat</strong> option is set <em>true</em>, this is never fired.</dd>
</dl>

<hr />
<h2><a name="buffer"></a>Buffer</h2>

<p>These API calls are used to update clients with the percentage of a file that&#39;s buffered into the player. This only applies to progressive downloads of media (<em>MP4/FLV/WebM</em> and <em>AAC/MP3/Vorbis</em>); streaming media (<em>HLS/RTMP/YouTube</em>) do not expose this behavior.</p>

<dl>
	<dt>getBuffer()</dt>
	<dd>Returns the current PlaylistItem&#39;s filled buffer, as a percentage (0 to 100) of the total video&#39;s length.</dd>
</dl>

	</ul>
	</dd>
</dl>

<hr />

<dl>
	<dt>getState()</dt>
	<dd>Returns the player&#39;s current playback state. These can be:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>IDLE</strong>: either playback has not started or playback was stopped (due to a stop() call or an error). Either the <em>play</em> or the <em>error</em> icon is visible in the display.</li>
		<li><strong>BUFFERING</strong>: user pressed play, but sufficient data to start playback has to be loaded first. The <em>buffering</em> icon is visible in the display.</li>
		<li><strong>PLAYING</strong>: the video is currently playing. No icon is visible in the display.</li>
		<li><strong>PAUSED</strong>: the video is currently paused. The <em>play</em> icon is visible in the display.</li>
	</ul>
	</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
	<dt>play(<em>state</em>)</dt>
	<dd>Toggles playback of the player. If the state is set <strong>true</strong> the player will start playing, if set <strong>false</strong> the player will pause and if omitted, the player will toggle playback.</dd>
	<dt>pause(<em>state</em>)</dt>
	<dd>Toggles playback of the player. If the state is set <strong>true</strong> the player will pause, if set <strong>false</strong> the player will start playing and if omitted, the player will toggle playback.</dd>
	<dt>stop()</dt>

		<li><strong>oldstate</strong> (String): the state the player moved from. Can be BUFFERING or PLAYING.</li>
	</ul>
	</dd>
	<dt>onBuffer(<em>callback</em>)</dt>
	<dd>Fired when the player enters the BUFFERING state. Event attributes:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>oldstate</strong> (String): the state the player moved from. Can be IDLE, PLAYING or PAUSED.</li>
	</ul>
	</dd>
	<dt>onIdle(<em>callback</em>)</dt>
	<dd>Fired when the player enters the IDLE state. Event attributes:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>oldstate</strong> (String): the state the player moved from. Can be BUFFERING, PLAYING or PAUSED.</li>
	</ul>
	</dd>
	<dt>onComplete(<em>callback</em>)</dt>
	<dd>Fired when an item completes playback. It has no event attributes.</dd>
	<dt>onError(<em>callback</em>)</dt>
	<dd>Fired when a media error has occurred, causing the player to stop playback and go into IDLE mode. Event attributes:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>message</strong> (String): The reason for the error. See <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1403682-troubleshooting-your-setup" target="_blank">Troubleshooting your Setup</a> for a list of possible media errors.</li>
	</ul>
	</dd>
</dl>

<p>Note a media error event is not fired when a player setup error occurs. Use <strong>onSetupError</strong> (see above) to catch these errors.</p>

<hr />
<h2><a name="seek"></a>Seek</h2>

<p>These API calls are used to retrieve and update the current media playback position.</p>

<dl>
	<dt>getPosition()</dt>
	<dd>Returns the current playback position in seconds, as a number.</dd>
	<dt>getDuration()</dt>
	<dd>Returns the currently playing PlaylistItem&#39;s duration in seconds, as a number. If a duration of <strong>-1</strong> is returned, the current media is a live stream and therefore has no position, duration or seek capability.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
	<dt>seek(<em>position</em>)</dt>
	<dd>Jump to the specified position within the currently playing item. The <strong>position</strong> is required and must be provided as an integer, in seconds.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>

	<dd>Fired after a seek has been requested either by scrubbing the controlbar or through the API. Event attributes:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>position</strong> (Number): The position of the player before the player seeks (in seconds).</li>
		<li><strong>offset</strong> (Number): The user requested position to seek to (in seconds). Note the actual position the player will eventually seek to may differ, e.g. because Flash progressive can only seek to keyframes and HLS can only seek to fragment boundaries.</li>
	</ul>
	</dd>
	<dt>onTime(<em>callback</em>)</dt>
	<dd>While the player is playing, this event is fired as the playback position gets updated. This may occur as frequently as 10 times per second. Event attributes:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>duration</strong> (Number): Duration of the current item in seconds.</li>
		<li><strong>position</strong> (Number): Playback position in seconds.</li>
	</ul>
	</dd>
</dl>

<p>Note that seeking for progressive downloads in Flash mode only works within the already downloaded portion. When seeking beyond that section, the video seeks to the last downloaded frame. This issue is not present for HTML5, so should only be relevant for IE8.</p>

<hr />

<h2><a name="advertising"></a>Advertising</h2>

<p>This API provides developers with more control over the advertising functionality of the <strong>Advertising</strong> edition of JW Player. For <strong>VAST</strong> advertising, this API allows impression verification, custom scheduling, tag waterfalling and multiple companions. For <strong>IMA</strong>, this API allows inserting multiple companions (through <em>onAdCompanions</em>), while the other ad API calls are only available for VAST.</p>

<dl>
	<dt>playAd(<em>tag</em>)</dt>
	<dd><span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">VAST and IMA.&nbsp;</span>Used to play an ad <strong><em>right now</em></strong>, which is primarily useful for situations where the built-in ad schedule of JW Player cannot be used.(e.g. for live streaming or dynamic&nbsp;ads for playlist items)&nbsp;It has a single attribute:

		<li>inside a JW Player event handler for <em>onTime</em>, to trigger a mid-roll.</li>
		<li>inside a event handler for <em>onBeforeComplete</em>, to trigger a post-roll.</li>
		<li>Outside of event handlers, only when the player is in the <strong>PLAYING</strong> state.</li>
	</ol>
	</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
	<dt>onAdClick(<em>callback</em>)</dt>
	<dd>VAST and IMA. Fired whenever a user clicks an ad to be redirected to its landing page. Event attributes:

		<li><strong>click</strong> (String): URL to link to when clicking the companion. Only available if the type is static.</li>
	</ol>
	</dd>
	<dt>onAdComplete(<em>callback</em>)</dt>

	Event attributes:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>tag</strong> (String): The ad tag that is currently playing.</li>
		<li><strong>message</strong> (String): The error message.</li>
	</ul>

<h2><a name="metadata"></a>Metadata</h2>

<p>This API call allows developers to listen for metadata embedded in the media file (e.g. dimensions or TX3G cues in MP4 files). It is intended debugging purposes. Do not rely on this API in production environments, since metadata callbacks are subject to sudden change!</p>

<dl>
	<dt>onMeta(<em>callback</em>)</dt>
	<dd>Fired when new metadata has been broadcasted by the player. Event attributes:
	<ul>
		<li><em>metadata</em> (Object): Object containing the new metadata. This can be metadata hidden in the media (XMP, ID3, keyframes) or metadata broadcasted by the playback provider (bandwidth, quality switches).</li>
	</ul>
