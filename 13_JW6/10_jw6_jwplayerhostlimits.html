<h2>What do these hosting limits on my dashboard mean?</h2>

<p>These hosting limits reflect a free service that we provide to all JW Player users. These 5 uploads and 500 hosted streams per month are intended to be used mainly for testing purposes. If you are intending to launch a website heavily dependent on video content, please consider <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/hosting-and-streaming/" target="_blank">JW Platform</a>.</p>

<h2>Why are you limiting the number of videos that I can show with your player?</h2>

<p>These limits are only in place if you are hosting videos with us, through your JW Player account. If you are using an external host, these limits do not apply. If we are not hosting your files, we will <strong>never</strong> shut down your players due to excessive video use.</p>

<h2>Can I create playlists with my uploaded content?</h2>

<p>Playlists cannot be generated with our free hosting solution.</p>

<h2>If I upgrade my account to a Pro, Premium, or Enterprise account, will I receive additional streams?</h2>

<p>No, upgrading your license will only change your player version and will not upgrade your streaming limits.</p>

<h2>I want to host additional files and/or offer more streams to my users. Can I upgrade my limits?</h2>

<p>Limits cannot be upgraded. We provide this service as an entry point for video hosting. If you are interested in a full-featured video platform that offers much more functionality, again&nbsp;we highly recommend checking out our JW Platform offering. Feel free to <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/contact-us/enterprise/" target="_blank">contact our sales team</a> for more information.</p>
