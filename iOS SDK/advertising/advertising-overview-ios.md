JW Player's advertising features help you to monetize your content with video ads while keeping your viewers engaged. JW Player supports standard ad types (VAST, VPAID, VMAP), accommodates third-party technologies (Google IMA SDK, FreeWheel SDK), and supports any ad server that returns the previously-mentioned ad types. You can customize your viewers' ad experiences with ad rules, ad breaks, and localized player messaging.
