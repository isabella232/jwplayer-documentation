After reading our [documentation](https://developer.jwplayer.com/sdk/ios/docs/developer-guide/), reviewing our [code samples](https://developer.jwplayer.com/ios-sdk/demos/), and examining our demo, you may still be unable to resolve an implementation issue. At this point, you should replicate the issue using the JW Player Open Source Demo for iOS and submit a support ticket that includes a link to a zipped Xcode project of a reproduction app.

Reproduction apps reduce the time necessary to resolve your issue in several ways:

- Clearly shows your implementation using our framework
- Eliminates non-essential code and libraries
- Enables the Support Team suggest code revisions

!!!
Be sure that your iOS app is written in Objective-C.
