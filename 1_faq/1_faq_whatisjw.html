<p>JW Player is the world&#39;s most popular embeddable media player for websites. It supports a wide array of platforms, browsers, and media formats. It is <a href="https://github.com/jwplayer/jwplayer">open-source</a> software which is easy to configure, customize, and extend.</p>

<p>If you are simply a viewer of JW Player, there is nothing to download and install. Everything is handled by the website itself.</p>

<h2>I&#39;m having problems viewing a video</h2>

<p>If you&#39;re having problems viewing a video, please see our example embed below:</p>

<div id="myElement" style="height: 270px; width: 480px; background-color: black; ">
<div id="Text" style="color: white; font-family: Sans-serif; text-align: center; padding-top:100px; a:link:white;">Uh oh!<br />
Your browser might not support JW Player 7<br />
See our <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1403653" style="color: gray;">Browser Reference</a> for more information.</div>
</div>
<script type="text/javascript">
var playerInstance = jwplayer("myElement");
playerInstance.setup({

<h3>If the above video is appearing, your browser or device supports JW Player 7!</h3>

<h2>I am still having problems viewing content in JW Player</h2>

<p>If there are still issues viewing a video, there are a few things to check:</p>

<dl>
	<dt><strong>Ensure that your browser or device supports JW Player 7</strong></dt>
	<dd>JW Player 7 requires a browser that supports HTML5. A list of fully supported browsers can be found <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1403653">here</a>. Please make sure your browser is the latest version.</dd>
	<dt><strong>Make sure that the latest version of Flash is installed</strong></dt>
	<dd>A minimum version of <strong>Adobe Flash 11.2</strong> is required for viewing Flash content. You can update Flash by visiting <a href="https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/">Adobe&#39;s website</a>.</dd>
	<dt><strong>Check your network</strong></dt>
	<dd>Since JW Player is a network-based video player, slow or firewalled networks will affect performance.
	<ul>
		<li>If viewing RTMP content, make sure that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_Messaging_Protocol">Port 1935</a> is unblocked by your network or firewall.</li>
		<li>Check your network speed with a <a href="http://www.speedtest.net/">free</a> <a href="http://www.measurementlab.net/tools/ndt">bandwidth</a> <a href="http://www.speakeasy.net/speedtest/">measuring</a> tool to ensure that you have the network capacity to view video content.</li>
		<li>Certain plugins and features are loaded from our content delivery network(CDN). Make sure that you are able to access files from:
		<pre>
http://p.jwpcdn.com</pre>

		<pre>
https://ssl.p.jwpcdn.com</pre>
		</li>
	</ul>
