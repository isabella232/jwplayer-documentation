<p>Welcome! We&#39;re excited to help you get started &mdash; JW Player makes it easy to publish a video that will play everywhere. This simple tutorial will walk you through embedding your first video with JW Player.</p>

<p>Before you start, <strong>prepare your content</strong>. You can publish a file from (1) a URL, or (2) from your machine.</p>
&nbsp;

<ol>
	<li><a href="http://dashboard.jwplayer.com" target="_blank">Sign in</a> to your JW Player dashboard</li>
	<li>On your dashboard homepage, locate the Quick Publish tool and select which type of content you are publishing (see diagram): (1) URL or (2) Upload</li>
	<li>Input your content of the selected type in the Quick Publish tool</li>
	<li>Publish Mode will open with a default player and your embed code ready to go</li>
	<li>Copy the embed code from Publish Mode, and paste it into your webpage&#39;s code &mdash; and you&#39;re all set!</li>
</ol>

<p><em><strong>Player Tip:</strong> If you&#39;d like to customize a player first, click through to the &quot;Players&quot; section and create a new player, or make changes to an existing one. Then, click &quot;embed&quot; on that player from the Player List to grab your embed code.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Content Tip:</strong> We keep track of all the content you add through the dashboard. If you&#39;d like to edit the title, description, or poster image, assign tags, or even add more content &amp; more, navigate to the Content section.</em></p>
