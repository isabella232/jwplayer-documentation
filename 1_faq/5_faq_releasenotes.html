<h1>JW Player 7.1.4</h1>
<a name="version714"></a>

<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re wondering: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened to JW 7.1.1-7.1.3?&rdquo; Do not worry! We&rsquo;re starting a new method of player releases. This method keeps certain builds internal-only, and introduces minor iterations throughout the development process. This versioning also goes hand-in-hand with our upcoming player release channels, which provides early access to these internal builds. We&rsquo;ll have more information on this shortly.</p>

<p>7.1.4 is a patch release that adds detection for when Flash is being throttled or blocked by Chrome. The player then reacts in an elegant way, removing skin elements, and allowing for direct interaction with the SWF. In addition to this, we have also fixed a couple of minor bugs that were really starting to... byte...? :B</p>

<h2>Updates</h2>

<ul>
	<li>VPAID 2.0 JavaScript creatives will render even when Flash is used as the main content video provider. Priority of creative choice is given to the order that they appear in the VAST response.</li>
	<li>When the player is rendering in Flash mode, SWF-based VPAID 1.0 ads will play if they are listed as the first or only creative source.</li>
	<li>Flash Throttling detection for Chrome.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Controls now fade properly even without user interaction</li>
	<li>Unknown CC track was appearing in captions menu when 608 captions and WebVTT captions were part of an HLS stream.</li>
	<li>Api call getVisualQuality() is now returning correct value instead of undefined.</li>
	<li>Ad complete API is now firing correctly for Flash VPAID ad creatives.</li>
	<li>Better handling of a Flash exception that occurs when calling setup on a bad flash embed.</li>
	<li>Certain VPAID 2.0 JavaScript creatives were showing JW Player controls instead of the controls that came with the creative.</li>
	<li>When Flash was blocked or not able to load the player would show a buffering icon, it now shows the native browser UI instead of JW Player UI until Flash is started.</li>
	<li>When using Autoplay, player would not resumed correctly after Chrome begins Power Save throttling.</li>
	<li>Fixed support for WebVTT captions in HLS live streams that were trailing behind timecodes.</li>
</ul>
<a name="version710"></a>

<h1>JW Player 7.1.0</h1>

<p>JW Player 7.1.0 is our first major feature update to JW7. This new version offers new UI changes and stability fixes. For advertising users, 7.1.0 allows Interactive VPAID 2.0 JavaScript creatives to be used on in HTML5 video players. This release also changes the behavior to the control bar when it is rendered either smaller than 300 px wide or when the interface elements get cluttered.</p>

<h2>Features:</h2>

<h3>VPAID 2.0</h3>

<p>HTML5/JavaScript Creatives will render on the following desktop browsers when the JW Player is using an HTML5 video provider in:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Chrome</li>
	<li>Safari</li>
	<li>FireFox</li>
	<li>Opera</li>
</ul>

<p>*Internet Explorer is not yet supported.</p>

<p>*Chrome on Android is not yet supported</p>

<p>Fullscreen iOS browsers will play VPAID 2.0 creatives but will not have interactive elements due to no native fullscreen API support. Chrome on Android devices is not yet supported.</p>

<p>Fullscreen iOS browsers will play VPAID 2.0 creatives but will not have interactive elements due to a lack of native fullscreen API support.</p>

<h3>Small Player UI/UX</h3>

<p>Devices with a smaller viewing area will now see a more mobile-friendly control bar UI. Font size has been increased and secondary control bar elements have been relocated to an overflow menu.</p>

<h2>Changes:</h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>on(&lsquo;adStarted&rsquo;)</strong> event added to listen for VPAID adStarted event.</li>
	<li><strong>on(&lsquo;adImpression&rsquo;)</strong> is fired when the VPAID ad impression event is fired instead of the adStarted event.</li>
	<li>Apostrophes are now accepted in image file names.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fixes:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Youtube videos will now correctly begin when our play button is touched on mobile devices.</li>
	<li>Long lists of captions will now be properly selectable in overlay menu.</li>
	<li>Improved menu visibility behavior when options are selected.</li>
	<li>Fixed player behavior when certain HTTP/HTTPS files were combined.</li>
	<li>Bug fixes and improvements with updated DASH provider.</li>
</ul>
<a name="version703"></a>

<h1>JW Player 7.0.3</h1>

<p>JW Player 7.0.3 is a patch on 7.0.2 that makes the logic for choosing video providers more in line with how a publisher sets up video fallback sources. 7.0.3 also squashes a few minor bugs.</p>

<h2>Changes</h2>

<p>JW7 relies less on setting a primary rendering mode (Flash/HTML5) and instead relies on source ordering. This grants publishers the ability to fallback between both HTML5 and Flash video providers. 7.0.3 optimizes this by transitioning away from the fallback logic being based on provider type and now based on the source file type.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong> Setting up a player with the following sources - mpd, m3u8, rtmp, mp4 - will default the player to use either an HTML5 DASH provider and then on the fly fallback to a Flash, HTML5 or HLS provider based on provider availability.</p>

<p>This is different than previous versions of JW Player as it was always HTML5 first - meaning setting up a player an m3u8 then mp4 would put the priority on the mp4 over the HLS source.</p>

<h2>Fixes</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Fixed touch events on Windows 10 devices to show controls appropriately.</li>
	<li>Fixed certain livestreams with 608 captions to display the captions at correct times.</li>
	<li>Fixed a display issue with poster images in audio only players.</li>
	<li>Fixed multi-line WebVTT captions that were not rendering.</li>
	<li>Fixed support for DISCONTINUITY-SEQUENCE in HLS.</li>
	<li>Fixed an HLS stream that would not play due to targetduration being incorrectly set to a negative value.</li>
</ul>
<a name="version702"></a>

<h1>JW Player 7.0.2</h1>
