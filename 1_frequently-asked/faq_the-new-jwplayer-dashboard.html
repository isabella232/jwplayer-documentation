<p>This article applies to users of the <strong>JW Platform</strong> dashboard who have or are planning to migrate to the new dashboard. </p>

<p>In the<a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/blog/new-publisher-dashboard/" target="_blank">new JW Player dashboard</a>you will notice a brand new design, and several new features including: &nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Deeper Analytics: Including device, domain &amp; country breakdowns.</li>
	<li>External URLs: Manage, embed &amp; analyze self-hosted (live) streams. </li>
	<li>Multiple Users: Manage access for more users in admin or editor roles.</li>
	<li>Player Downloads: Get the self-hosting ZIPs, including our mobile SDKs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Moving to our new dashboard will not affect your content delivery, in-progress transcodes, API integrations or billing. Only the user interface will be updated (instantly and seamlessly). Watch the <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/2231621-video-the-new-dashboard" target="_blank">video demo of the dashboard</a> for a helpful walk-through. <br />

<strong>Publish Mode</strong></p>

<p>On pages from which you can embed players or content, you will notice the Publish Mode widget at the top of the page. &nbsp;Each &ldquo;Embed&rdquo; link or button will open Publish Mode to create your single line embed code. &nbsp;Additionally, if you are embedding a single video, you can choose to include schema.org SEO tags which automatically pulls from your video metadata. &nbsp;You can also use Publish Mode to preview content using the preview page link. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Content: Video Library and Playlists </strong></p>

<p>Under the content section you will find your video library and your playlists. &nbsp;You can bulk add videos (or audio) by uploading files or adding external URLs. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Content Detail</strong></p>

<p>Add tags, metadata, tracks and view sources for your video. &nbsp;Within the tracks tab, add and edit caption files using our <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/blog/new-video-caption-editor/" target="_blank">NEW captions editor tool</a>. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Analytics</strong></p>

<p>Monitor your content performance, and look at activity by device, geography, engagement, and more. Player activity is associated with a unique media ID, to ensure that everything is attributed accurately.
