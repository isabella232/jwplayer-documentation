<p>Welcome! We&#39;re excited to help you get started &mdash; JW Player makes it easy to publish a video that will play everywhere. This tutorial will walk you through publishing your first video with the JW Player dashboard.</p>
<p>If you haven't already, be sure to read <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1403727 "><em>What is JW Player?</em></a> to make sure this is the solution you need.</p>
<a name="step-1"></a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>STEP 1</h4>
<h2>Sign Up</h2>
<p> If you have already signed up for a JW Player account, and you have also activated your email address, skip to <a href="#step-2">Step 2</a>.</p>
<p>In this example, we'll look at the Free sign-up process. If you'd like to explore a JW Player Premium account or above, visit our <a href="https://www.jwplayer.com/pricing/">pricing page</a>.</p>
<h3>Free Sign-Up</h3>
<p>To sign up for a Free JW Player account, enter your email address at <a href="https://www.jwplayer.com/sign-up/" target="_blank">jwplayer.com/sign-up</a>. </p>
<p><img src="http://support-static.jwplayer.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/faqs/free-user-signup.png" alt="Free Sign-Up Email Field" style="width:80%; border:1px solid #e6e6e6;"/></p>
<h3>Activate Your Account</h3>
<p>Confirm your email address by clicking the "Activate Now" button in the email that we sent you after you signed up in the previous step.</p>
<p><img src="http://support-static.jwplayer.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/faqs/activation-email.png" alt="The 'Activate Your Account' Email" style="width:30%; border:1px solid #e6e6e6;"/></p>
<a name="step-2"></a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>STEP 2</h4>
<h2>Prepare Your Video(s)</h2>
<p>Is the content you'd like to publish coming from your computer, or from <a href="#add-URL">elsewhere</a> on the internet?</p>
<p>If you've already uploaded your content, skip to <a href="#step-3">Step 3</a>.</p>
<a name="upload"></a>
<h3>Uploading from your computer</h3>
<!-- <div style="width:35%; float:left; text-align:left; padding:0px 20px 20px 0px; border:1px solid #e6e6e6;">-->
<!--</div>-->
<p>If you're adding content from your computer, note where the file is located in your folders.</p>
<p>Navigate to the <a href="https://dashboard.jwplayer.com/#/content/list">content list</a> in your JW Player Dashboard. </p>
<p>Click the blue "Add Uploads" button near the top left side of the page.</p>
<p><img src="http://support-static.jwplayer.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/faqs/content-list-add-uploads.png" alt="Content List" style="width:50%; border:1px solid #e6e6e6;"/></p>
<p>Select the file (or files) from the filepicker that appers.</p>
<p>As the JW Platform is processing your uploads, you will see a status bar appear at the bottom of your browser window.</p>
<p><img src="http://support-static.jwplayer.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/faqs/upload-status-bar_1200px.png" alt="Upload Status Bar" style="width:100%; border:1px solid #e6e6e6;"/>
</p>
<p>Click the blue "details" button in this status bar to view the progress of your individual upload(s).</p>
<p><img src="http://support-static.jwplayer.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/faqs/uploads-progress-modal_600px.png" alt="Uploads Progress Modal" style="width:50%; border:1px solid #e6e6e6;"/></p>
<p>From this modal you may pause or cancel any  or all of your uploads.</p>
<p>As the file uploads complete, the videos will appear in your content list. At this time, they may still be "processing," but you can start adding <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1469776">metadata &amp; more</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="add-URL"></a>
<h3>Adding from the internet</h3>
<p>To add content already hosted on the internet into your JW Player content library, get the URL for that content.</p>
<p>Note: The video URL is not the same as the page URL. A video URL will be structured like the below example, ending in a video file extension (like <strong>.mp4</strong>). </p>
<p><img src="http://support-static.jwplayer.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/faqs/file-url.png" alt="Media URL contains file extension" style="width:46%; border:1px solid #e6e6e6;"/></p>
<p><img src="http://support-static.jwplayer.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/faqs/page-url.png" alt="Not a Media URL â€“ no file extension" style="width:65%; border:1px solid #e6e6e6;"/></p>
<p><em>If your video URL does not have a file extension appended, but you are <strong>certain</strong> that it is an accepted media format, continue with the URL you have. (Read our <a href="/customer/portal/articles/1403635">Media Formats Reference</a> for details on supported file formats.)</em></p>
<p>Select "add URL" from the dropdown on the blue content button in the content list page.</p>
<p><img src="http://support-static.jwplayer.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/faqs/add-URL-buttons.png" alt="Add URL button" style="width:45%; border:1px solid #e6e6e6;"/></p>
<p>When you click "Add URLs", a modal will appear. One or more URLs can be entered here &mdash; click "+ another" to add more than one.</p>
<p><img src="http://support-static.jwplayer.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/faqs/add-via-URL-modal.png" alt="Add URL modal" style="width:80%; border:1px solid #e6e6e6;"/></p>
<p>Paste your URL(s) here, and click "Add" when you are done.</p>
<p>These items will appear in your JW Player content library, and from there you can add <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1469776">metadata &amp; more</a> to each media record.</p>
<a name="step-3"></a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<h2>Customize Your Player</h2>
<p>Each new JW Player account contains two example players: one responsive, and one fixed-width. These players are ready to go! If you don't need to customize a player, skip to <a href="#step-5">Step 5</a></p> 
<p>To get started, you can edit one of these existing players &mdash; or you can create a new player by clicking the blue "New Player" button on the left-side of the player list page.</p>
<p><img src="http://support-static.jwplayer.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/faqs/player-list.png" alt="Player List Page" style="width:100%; border:1px solid #e6e6e6;"/></p>
<p>Each player detail page contains options for editing player behavior, design, and functionality. For more about updating these settings, see the articles in our <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/topics/601064">Branding &amp; UX section</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://support-static.jwplayer.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/faqs/player-detail.png" alt="Player Detail Page" style="width:100%; border:1px solid #e6e6e6;"/></p>
<a name="step-4"></a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<h2>Embed</h2>
<p>Once your content and player are ready, you can click "embed" from anywhere in the dashboard to trigger <strong>Publish Mode</strong>. <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2160275#publish-mode
">Click here</a> to learn more about Publish Mode.</p>
<p><img src="http://support-static.jwplayer.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/faqs/publish-mode.png" alt="Publish Mode" style="width:100%; border:1px solid #e6e6e6;"/></p>
<p>From here, you can swap out the selected player or content &mdash; the "change" buttons will bring you to your content or players lists to make a new selection.</p>
<p>In the "embed" section, select the "iFrame"  option if you do not have access to your website's &lt;head&gt; code.</p>
<p>Copy the embed code.</p>
<p>Back on your own website in "editing" mode (or logged in as an admin), paste your embed code at the spot in the article or post in which you'd like to place your video.</p>
<p><img src="http://support-static.jwplayer.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/faqs/paste-into-code-editor.png" alt="Code Editor" style="width:100%; border:1px solid #e6e6e6;"/></p>
<p>Depending on which website tool you're using, you'll want to make sure that you're in "source"/"code" view, or in an "embed" editor. If you're building your own website, this embed code goes anywhere you'd like in the &lt;body&gt;.</p>
<p>Then, be sure to save &amp; publish your page, just as you would with any other article or post.</p>
<a name="step-5"></a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<h2>Track Performance</h2>
<p>Once your video is live, you're ready to see how it's doing!</p>
<p>In the JW Player dashboard, navigate to the <a href="https://dashboard.jwplayer.com/#/analytics/overview">Analytics</a> section.</p>
<p><img src="http://support-static.jwplayer.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/faqs/analytics-dashboard.png" alt="Analytics in the Dashboard" style="width:100%; border:1px solid #e6e6e6;"/></p>
<p>Here, you'll be able to see an overview of your top content and overall video activity, view your content performance stats in a list, view performance by domain, and also view real-time data in the "<a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2371336">Right Now</a>" section.</p>

<p><a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2142460">Click here</a> to read more about JW Player Analytics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<!--
<p>Before you start, <strong>prepare your content</strong>. You can publish a file by: 
<ol type="A">
<li><strong>Adding a URL</strong> from a video hosted elsewhere, or</li> 
<li><strong>Uploading</strong> from your machine.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Once you have your content ready:

<ol>
	<li><a href="http://dashboard.jwplayer.com" target="_blank">Sign in</a> to your JW Player dashboard</li>
	<li>On your dashboard homepage, locate the Quick Publish tool and select which type of content you are publishing (see diagram): (A) URL or (B) Upload</li>
	<li>Input your content of the selected type in the Quick Publish tool</li>
	<li>Publish Mode will open with a default player and your embed code ready to go</li>
	<li>Copy the embed code from Publish Mode, and paste it into your webpage&#39;s code &mdash; and you&#39;re all set!</li>
</ol>

<h3>Player Tip</h3>
<p> If you&#39;d like to customize a player before embedding, click through to the <a href="https://dashboard.jwplayer.com/#/players/list" target="_blank">Players section</a> and create a new player, or make changes to an existing one. Then, click &quot;embed&quot; on that player from the Players List to grab your embed code.</p>
<h3>Content Tip</h3>
<p>JW Player keeps track of the content you add through Quick Publish. If you&#39;d like to edit the title, description, or poster image of a piece of content, assign tags, or even add more, navigate to the <a href="https://dashboard.jwplayer.com/#/content/list" target="_blank">Content section</a>.</p>
