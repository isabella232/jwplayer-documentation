<h2>About the JW Player API</h2>

<p>The JW Player API allows a developer to control and customize their video player behavior via external Javascript. This allows for things like external playback control, dynamic ad insertion, custom visual playlists, or even slides that play alongside video content.</p>

<h3>What are some things that I can do with the API?</h3>

<p>We have an extensive list of examples available in our <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/topics/564475-javascript-api/articles">API section</a>. Some good areas to get started include:</p>

<h3>Standard API Examples</h3>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1436999-example-adding-a-download-button">Adding a Download Button</a> - Allow your users to download the video file that is currently playing.</li>
	<li><a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1439411-example-a-chromeless-player">Creating a Chromeless Player</a> - Allows you to use your own external controls for playback.</li>
	<li><a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1439570-example-loading-new-playlists">Loading New Playlists</a> - Dynamically load your own playlists into JW Player.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advertising API Examples</h3>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1480795-example-ad-impression-verification">Ad Impression Tracking</a> - Useful for tracking ads on a page or via custom analytics.</li>
	<li><a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1480844-example-custom-ad-scheduling">Dynamic Ad Schedules</a> - Can be used for ad insertion during live streams or at choice points during VOD content.</li>
	<li><a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1434336-example-multiple-companion-ads">Multiple Companion Ads</a> - How to extract and display companion ads from VAST tags.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="custom-analytics"></a>

<h2>How do I use custom analytics to track my player&#39;s use?</h2>

<p>We have an article about <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1417188">Tracking Player Behavior with Analytics</a>. As long as you are able to send pings to your desired analytics platform via Javascript, any system can be easily tied into the JW Player API.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="drm"></a>

<h2>How do I protect my video content?</h2>

<p>JW Player currently offers two methods of content protection via the <strong>Enterprise</strong> edition:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>AES 128 Encryption</strong> - Used with HLS streaming. <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1430261">Read more...</a></li>
	<li><strong>DRM using HTML5 EME</strong> - Used with DASH streaming. <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/2020483">Read more...</a></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="ads"></a>

<h2>If I wish to run ads via a third party plugin, do I still need an Ads license?</h2>

<p>To run video ads in any form, you <strong>must</strong> be properly licensed with an Ad version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="youtube"></a>

<h2>How do I use YouTube videos with JW Player?</h2>

<p>We have an article detailing the process available <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1406725">here</a>. As the article mentions, the following is <strong>not</strong> supported when using JW Player with Youtube content:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Monetizing Youtube content with JW Player Advertising</li>
	<li>Flash Playback</li>
	<li>Removal of Youtube watermarks or integrated features</li>
</ul>

<p>If more flexibility is required, JW Player also offers its own integrated video hosting, <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/products/jwplatform/">JW Platform</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="customize"></a>

<h2>How can I customize my player?</h2>

<p>JW Player&#39;s appearance is fully customizable thanks to its <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1406968-using-jw-player-skins">CSS-based skinning model</a>. In addition, JW Player can be further branded via a custom <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1406865-branding-your-player">logo</a>, and <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1406865-branding-your-player">right-click</a> menu.</p>

<p>In addition to its appearance, JW Player's functionality is also highly cusomizable. Check out the Branding &amp; UX Topic articles, or if you're a developer, the <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1413113">Configuration Reference</a> on our Developer Portal.
</p>
<a name="upgrading"></a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Which JW Player license am I using? How can I upgrade?</h2>

<p>Find your license details on the <a href="https://dashboard.jwplayer.com/#/account/billing" target="_blank">Billing page</a> of your JW Player dashboard. (You must be logged in to see this page).</p>
<p>Upgrades from Free to Premium are handled via our <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/pricing">Pricing Page</a>. If you are interested in Enterprise, Ads, or High-Volume hosting *amp; streaming, <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/contact-us/">contact us</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>I&#39;ve just upgraded my license. Why is my player not reflecting this change?</h2>

<p>After upgrading your license, the key found on your <a href="https://account.jwplayer.com/#/account" target="_blank">account page</a> will change to reflect this. As a result, you will need to manually update your self-hosted key on your website. If a cloud-hosted library was utilized, this change will happen automatically.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>I am interested in reselling JW Player, how do I find more information?</h2>

<p>If you are interested in becoming a reseller for JW Player, please <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/contact-us">Contact Us</a> directly.</p>
