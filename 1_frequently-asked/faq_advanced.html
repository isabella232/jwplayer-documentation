<p>This section is for users who are looking to extend JW Player&#39;s functionality beyond simple embeds. This includes video ads, player APIs, and enterprise features. If you are reading this section, it is highly suggested that you be familiar with how to both <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1406723">Embed</a> and <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1413113-configuration-options-reference">Configure</a> JW Player.</p>
<a name="ads"></a>

<h2>Advertising</h2>

<h3>How do I monetize my videos?</h3>

<p>If you&#39;re interested in using advertisements with your video content, you can do this by utilizing a JW Player <strong>Ads license</strong>. Using VAST or Google IMA with JW Player allows for things like:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1433722-vast3-ad-pods">VAST 3 Ad Pods</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1432024-scheduling-ad-breaks-">Ad Scheduling</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1665150-ad-tag-waterfalling">Tag Waterfalling</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Additional configuration info can be found in our <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/topics/605644-video-ads/articles">Advertising Support Articles</a>.</p>

<h3>Where do I get my ad tags from?</h3>

<p>You&#39;ll need an ad network or server to supply your tags. Some additional information can be found in our <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1431638-ad-formats-reference">Ad Reference</a> article.</p>

<h3>How do ads work?</h3>

<p>Video advertisements are XML-based files, which essentially tell a video player how to behave during ad playback. For more information about the basics of VAST:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1482127-static-vast-xml-tag">Static VAST</a> - A quick runthrough of how a VAST file works and is interpreted by JW Player</li>

</ul>
<a name="api"></a>

<h2>Working with the JW Player API</h2>

<p>The JW Player API allows a developer to control and customize their video player behavior via external Javascript. This allows for things like external playback control, dynamic ad insertion, custom visual playlists, or even slides that play alongside video content.</p>

<h3>What are some things that I can do with the API?</h3>

<p>We have an extensive list of examples available in our <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/topics/564475-javascript-api/articles">API section</a>. Some good areas to get started include:</p>

<h3>Standard API Examples</h3>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1436999-example-adding-a-download-button">Adding a Download Button</a> - Allow your users to download the video file that is currently playing.</li>
	<li><a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1439411-example-a-chromeless-player">Creating a Chromeless Player</a> - Allows you to use your own external controls for playback.</li>
	<li><a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1439570-example-loading-new-playlists">Loading New Playlists</a> - Dynamically load your own playlists into JW Player.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Advertising API Examples</h3>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1480795-example-ad-impression-verification">Ad Impression Tracking</a> - Useful for tracking ads on a page or via custom analytics.</li>
	<li><a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1480844-example-custom-ad-scheduling">Dynamic Ad Schedules</a> - Can be used for ad insertion during live streams or at choice points during VOD content.</li>
	<li><a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1434336-example-multiple-companion-ads">Multiple Companion Ads</a> - How to extract and display companion ads from VAST tags.</li>
</ul>
<a name="track"></a>

<h2>How do I use analytics to track my player&#39;s use?</h2>

<p>We have an article about <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1417188">Tracking Player Behavior with Analytics</a>. As long as you are able to send pings to your desired analytics platform via Javascript, any system can be easily tied into the JW Player API.</p>
<a name="drm"></a>

<h2>Privacy and Security</h2>

<h3>How do I protect my video content?</h3>

<p>JW Player currently offers two methods of content protection via the <strong>Enterprise</strong> edition:</p>

<!-- CROSSDOMAIN FILE LOADING CONTENT BELOW -->


<p>This guide describes the cross-domain file loading (security) restrictions associated with the Adobe Flash plugin and JavaScript in HTML5 browsers/devices.</p>

<p>The act of disallowing domains from accessing content is a security measure that prevents users from basically leeching your files and using them elsewhere. This functionally works as a whitelist, in that all domains are inherently blocked unless specified. A basic walkthrough of the process is as follows:</p>

<ol>
	<li>A JW Player hosted on DomainA wishes to access a VTT file that is hosted on DomainB.</li>
	<li>DomainB sees this request and confirms that DomainA should have access.</li>
	<li>If DomainA is allowed access, the file is served.</li>
</ol>

<p>Each version, Flash and HTML5, has a distinct method of allowing/denying access across domains. Let&#39;s explore the differences.</p>

<h2><a name="flash"></a>Crossdomain in Flash</h2>

<p>The Adobe Flash Player contains a <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/security.html">crossdomain security mechanism</a>, similar to JavaScript&rsquo;s <a href="#javascript">Cross-Site Scripting</a> restrictions. It impacts publishers using JW Player on Flash capable browsers and devices, denying to load the following files across from another domain:</p>

<ul>
	<li>RSS feeds</li>
	<li>XML skins</li>
	<li>VTT, SRT &amp; DFXP files</li>
	<li>M3U8 manifests &amp; TS fragments</li>
	<li>SMIL manifests</li>
</ul>

<h3>Crossdomain XML</h3>

<p>Crossdomain security restrictions can be lifted by hosting a <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/articles/crossdomain_policy_file_spec.html">crossdomain.xml</a> file on the server that contains the files.</p>

<p>For example, if DomainA.com is requesting a file from DomainB.com, you will need to configure crossdomain.xml on DomainB.com to grant access.&nbsp;This crossdomain file must be placed in the root of your domain or subdomain. For example:</p>

<pre>
http://www.myserver.com/crossdomain.xml
http://videos.myserver.com/crossdomain.xml
</pre>

<p>Before the Flash Player attempts to load XML files, SWF files or raw data from any domain other than the one hosting your player, it checks the remote site for the existence of such a <em>crossdomain.xml</em> file. If Flash finds it, and if the configuration permits external access of its data, then the data is loaded. If not, the operation will not be allowed.</p>

<h3>Allow All Example</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of a <em>crossdomain.xml</em> that allows access to the domain&rsquo;s data from SWF files on any site:</p>

<pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE cross-domain-policy SYSTEM &quot;http://www.adobe.com/xml/dtds/cross-domain-policy.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;cross-domain-policy&gt;
   &lt;allow-access-from domain=&quot;*&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/cross-domain-policy&gt;
</pre>

<p>Note that this example sets your server wide open. Any SWF file can load any data from your site, which might lead to security issues.</p>

<h3>Restrict Access Example</h3>

<p>Here is another example <em>crossdomain.xml</em>, this time permitting Flash file access from only a number of domains:</p>

<pre>
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE cross-domain-policy SYSTEM &quot;http://www.adobe.com/xml/dtds/cross-domain-policy.dtd&quot;&gt;
&lt;cross-domain-policy&gt;
   &lt;allow-access-from domain=&quot;*.domain1.com&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;allow-access-from domain=&quot;www.domain2.com&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/cross-domain-policy&gt;
</pre>

<p>Note the use of the wildcard symbol: any subdomain from domain1 can load data, whereas domain2 is restricted to only the www subdomain.</p>

<p>Crossdomain policy files can even further finegrain access, e.g. to certain ports or HTTP headers. For a detailed overview, see <a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/142/tn_14213.html">Adobe&rsquo;s Crossdomain documentation</a>.</p>

<div id="html5">&nbsp;</div>

<h2><a name="javascript"></a>Crossdomain in JavaScript</h2>

<p>In JavaScript, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">Cross-Site Scripting</a> mechanism similar to <a href="#flash">that in Flash</a> exists. It impacts publishers using JW Player on HTML5 capable browsers and devices, denying to load the following files from another domain:</p>

<ul>
	<li>RSS feeds</li>
	<li>XML skins</li>
	<li>VTT, SRT &amp; DFXP files</li>
</ul>

<p>Generally, these file loads will fail if there&rsquo;s no crossdomain access. Most browsers will display an error in their debug console.</p>

<h3>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</h3>

<p>Crossdomain access can be enabled in JavaScript with a mechanism similar to that in Flash. Instead of hosting a <em>crossdomain.xml</em> file, crossdomain access is enabled per file, through an additional HTTP response header (the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/">CORS</a> header). Here&#39;s what the header looks like:</p>

<pre>
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
</pre>

<p>Note that this example sets your file wide open. Any script from any site can load the file and do whatever it wants.</p>

<h3>Restrict Access Example</h3>

<p>Here is another example <em>CORS header</em>, this time permitting the JavaScript file from only a number of domains:</p>

<pre>
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *.domain1.com www.domain2.com
</pre>

<p>Note the use of the wildcard symbol: any subdomain from domain1 can load data, whereas domain2 is restricted to only the www subdomain.</p>

<p>Options to limit protocols and ports can be added. <a href="http://enable-cors.org/">See the enabled-cors.org site</a> for more info. The site lists how to enable CORS headers for various popular webservers, frameworks and serverside languages.</p>

<h2>Cloud-hosted players and Crossdomain restrictions</h2>

<p>When using our cloud-hosted player and hosting external files on your own site (captions, playlists, etc.) you will need to give our CDN crossdomain access. This ensures that the external files can be properly accessed and loaded by our player. The crossdomain.xml file on a personal domain should have the following line added to ensure this:</p>

<pre>
allow-access-from domain=&quot;*.jwpcdn.com&quot;
</pre>

<p>Likewise, the domain&#39;s CORS headers should be adjusted to allow this access as well.</p>

<h2>How do I embed JW Player?</h2>

<p>JW Player 7 relies on Javascript for its video playing functionality, regardless of rendering in Flash or HTML5. Both our <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1413089-javascript-api-reference">API</a> and <a href="support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1413113-configuration-options-reference">configuration</a> require Javascript. A basic JW Player embedding walkthrough can be found on our <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1406723-mp4-video-embed">Embedding JW Player</a> article.</p>
<a name="youtube"></a>

<h2>How do I use YouTube videos with JW Player?</h2>

<p>We have an article detailing the process available <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1406725-youtube-video-embed">here</a>. As the article mentions, the following is <strong>not</strong> supported when using JW Player with Youtube content:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Monetizing Youtube content with JW Player Advertising</li>
	<li>Flash Playback</li>
	<li>Removal of Youtube watermarks or integrated features</li>
</ul>

<p>If more flexibility is required, JW Player also offers its own integrated video hosting, <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/products/jwplatform/">JW Platform</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="stream"></a>

<h2>How do I stream content to my JW Player?</h2>

<p>JW Player currently supports three main streaming methods. These can be used for either Live or pre-recorded Video on Demand(VOD) content:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>RTMP - </strong>A Flash-based protocol used for streaming content. <strong>RTMP does not work on mobile devices.</strong> <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1430349-about-rtmp-streaming">Read more...</a></li>
	<li><strong>HLS - </strong>An HTTP-based method of streaming created by Apple. Supported on some mobile devices, but requires Flash for Desktop browsers. <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1430189-about-hls-streaming">Read more...</a></li>
	<li><strong>DASH - </strong>An emerging standard that streams content via HTTP. Provides more flexibility than HLS, but is not yet as widely used. <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/2020482-about-dash-streaming">Read more...</a></li>
</ul>
More information on creating and serving these streams can be found in the following Wowza articles:
