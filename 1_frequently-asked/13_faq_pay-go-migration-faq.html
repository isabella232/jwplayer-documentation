<p>This article applies to customers on the <strong>JW Platform</strong> dashboard under the <strong>Pay-as-you-go</strong> billing model. </p>

<p><br />
<strong><span>Do I have to Migrate to the new dashboard?</strong></p>

<p>Yes. We will sunset the JW Platform dashboard on March 1st, 2016. The new dashboard retains all existing functionality though, plus adds a host of new features (like deeper analytics, management of external URLs and multiple users, and access to player downloads). </p>

<p>Moving to our new dashboard will not affect your content delivery, in-progress transcodes, API integrations or billing. Only the user interface will be updated (instantly and seamlessly). &nbsp;</p>
&nbsp;

<p><strong>Do I have to migrate to the new billing model?</strong></p>

<p>Yes. We will stop accepting new Pay-as-you-go payments on March 1st, 2016. At that date, we will also sunset the JW Platform dashboard and migrate its users to our new JW Player dashboard. </p>

<p>For typical Pay-as-you-go usage, we now offer the JW Player Premium edition. Priced at $299/year, it includes 50GB storage forever and 250GB streaming per month. Depending upon your usage volumes, this is 2 to 10 times cheaper than your existing Pay-as-you go pricing! On top of that, we offer a 50% discount if you have an outstanding storage or streaming balance.</p>

<p>If you stream and/or store more than the amounts included with JW Player Premium, we will contact you with a custom offer. Alternatively, feel free to contact us for more info.</p>
&nbsp;

<p><strong>If I migrate to JW Player Free, can I later upgrade to Premium?</strong></p>

<p>Yes. You can upgrade to JW Player Premium at any time. Do note the 50% discount we offer current Pay-as-you-go customers will expire after March 1, 2016.</p>
