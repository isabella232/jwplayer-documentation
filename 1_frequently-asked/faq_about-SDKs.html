<br />

<br />
&nbsp;The&nbsp;JW Player Android SDK&nbsp;enables developers to include JW Player directly into any Android Application using native Java to manage the player.&nbsp;One of the popular features&nbsp;our SDK offers over our Web Player is the ability to autoplay your videos on mobile devices,&nbsp;something the Web Player&nbsp;cannot achieve&nbsp;due to the restrictions of modern browsers.&nbsp;Expand&nbsp;your content reach to include a&nbsp;wider mobile audience with a native Android App and visit our <a href="http://developer.jwplayer.com/android-sdk/">Developer&#39;s Guide</a> for more details regarding our API&nbsp;and Features.</p>

<h2><strong>Q: How do I get the Android SDK?</strong></h2>

<p><strong>A:</strong>&nbsp;If you are interested in our Android&nbsp;SDK please&nbsp;contact us at <strong>support+sdk@jwplayer.com</strong>&nbsp;and tell us&nbsp;what you are trying to build. We will work with you to understand and meet your requirements and forward your inquiry to a Sales Representative.</p>

<h2><strong>Q: Is the JW Player Android SDK included with my Premium/Ads/Enterprise license?</strong></h2>

<p><strong>A:</strong> No, the Android SDK is priced separately and is considered a different product. Please email us at <strong>support+sdk@jwplayer.com</strong> and walk us through what you are trying to build and what you are looking for. We will&nbsp;help you get up and running in no time.</p>

<h2><strong>Q: I&#39;ve purchased the SDK software, but where do I download it?</strong></h2>

<p><strong>A:</strong> If you have an SDK license, all you need to do is login to your Unified Dashboard and navigate to <a href="https://dashboard.jwplayer.com/#/players/downloads">Players / License Keys&nbsp;&amp; Downloads</a> where you will find your Download Link and SDK License Key.&nbsp;If you cannot find it, please feel free to contact us at <strong>support+sdk@jwplayer.com</strong> for further assistance.</p>

<h2><strong>Q: When I compile my application I get &quot;License Edition INVALID is not valid for JW Player Android SDK.&quot; error.</strong></h2>

<p><strong>A:</strong>&nbsp;To fix this, make sure to<span style="line-height: 20.8px;">&nbsp;login to your Unified Dashboard and navigate to&nbsp;</span><a href="https://dashboard.jwplayer.com/#/players/downloads">Players / License Keys&nbsp;&amp; Downloads</a>&nbsp;there you will find your<span style="line-height: 20.8px;">&nbsp;Android</span><span style="line-height: 20.8px;">&nbsp;SDK License Key copy that and follow the instructions in our <a href="http://developer.jwplayer.com/sdk/android/docs/developer-guide/getting-started/library-project-setup/">Developer&#39;s Guide</a> to include the License Key in your Android Manifest.</span>&nbsp;If you are still having trouble with your license key please contact us at&nbsp;<strong>support+sdk@jwplayer.com</strong> to validate your key.</p>

<h2><strong>Q: When I launch my emulator, I see all kinds of errors and strange behavior.</strong></h2>

<p><strong>A:</strong> <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: The Android Media Player is known to be unstable when running in Android emulators, often throwing &quot;Unknown Android MediaPlayer error (extra = -2147483648).&quot; We strongly recommend using physical devices to develop and test apps you build with the JW Player SDK.</p>

<h2><strong>Q: Can I get the source code of the Demo Application included in the SDK Package?</strong></h2>

<p><strong>A:</strong> The demo application source code for our 2.x Android SDK now lives on GitHub at:<br />
<a href="https://github.com/jwplayer/jwplayer-sdk-android-demo"><strong>https://github.com/jwplayer/jwplayer-sdk-android-demo</strong></a></p>

<h2><strong>Q: Can I try my own video URL in the Demo Application?</strong></h2>

<p><strong>A:</strong>&nbsp;Sure, while running the app on the top right side of the screen you have an options menu. If you scroll down you&#39;ll find the &quot;Enter Stream URL&quot; option.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Q: How do I remove the demo app from my device?</strong></h2>

<p><strong>A:</strong> To uninstall the demo app, long-tap the JW Player Mobile icon in the app drawer, and drag it to the top of the screen to the Uninstall icon.</p>
