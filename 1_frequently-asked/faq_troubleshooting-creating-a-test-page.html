<p>When the JW Player Support Team is helping to troubleshoot a JW Player issue (direct support available for <a href="https://www.jwplayer.com/pricing/" target="_blank">JW Player Premium</a> and above customers only), it helps us a great deal to have a reproduction page (also known as a test page). This test page allows us to do a few things: 
<ul>
<li><strong>Reproduce the issue you are seeing</strong> (this helps us rule out browser, device, or firewall issues).</li>
<li><strong>Cleanly determine the cause of your issue</strong>, with no extra code in the way</li>
<li><strong>Send you back a link</strong> to an updated page, if we have a code suggestion or correction</li>
<li><strong>Escalate the issue</strong> internally, if necessary</li>
</ul>
 <!-- where we can reproduce the issue you are seeing. Once we can reliably reproduce your issue, we can get to work determining the cause.<strong> </strong>And then if we have any suggestions or code corrections, for example, we can then send you back a link to an updated page. We also use this test page to escalate any potential bugs internally, if necessary.<br> --> 
  We can usually see what you are trying to do by reading your code, but it is also helpful to know:
 <ul>
 <li>Your exact reproduction steps</li>
 <li>What you are expecting the player to do</li>
 <li>What the player is actually doing</li>

 </ul> 
</p>
<p>By using a basic embed of our player, we can help isolate the part of your code that is causing the problem. Completing this step properly will save time for you and for our support team, getting your videos back up and running as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>What does a good test page include?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The JW Player Javascript library URL you are using to load our player, and if necessary, the self-hosted license key</li>
	<li>The HTML &lt;div&gt; tag for our player</li>
	<li>Your jwplayer().setup()</li>
	<li>List of reproduction steps, expected behavior, and actual outcome</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we are experts when it comes to our player,  <strong>we cannot help you debug any code on the page that does not belong to us</strong>. Therefore, it is also important to note that there are a few things that should not be included in your reproduction page.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>What does a good test page NOT include?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Any other Javascript code or libraries not required for our player, like jQuery or require.js</li>
	<li>Extra&nbsp;CSS code or stylesheets&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Test Page Template</h2>
<p>Here is a template for you to use when making a reproduction page:</p>

&lt;head&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;http://your_cloud-hosted_player_URL_or_self-hosted_jwplayer.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;!-- if necessary: &lt;script&gt;jwplayer.key=&quot;your_self-hosted_license_key&quot;;&lt;/script&gt; --&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&nbsp;   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Reproduction steps:&lt;/b&gt; Please state the steps necessary to reproduce this issue
&nbsp;   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
