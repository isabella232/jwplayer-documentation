-->
<p>The <strong>Platinum and Enterprise</strong> editions of JW Player has built-in support for several leading video ad frameworks: <em>VAST/VPAID</em>, <em>Google IMA</em>, and <em>FreeWheel</em>. Not every VAST feature is supported at present, and FreeWheel uses proprietary request and response formats. See <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1431638-ad-formats-reference" target="_blank">Supported Ad Formats</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>In order to start running video ads in JW Player, you need the following three things:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A valid license for the <strong>Platinum or Enterprise</strong> editions of JW Player. The Free and Premium&nbsp;editions <strong>do not</strong> support advertising. See our <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/pricing/" target="_blank">Pricing page</a> if you are interested in running ads with JW Player.</li>
	<li>A working embed of the <em>Ads</em> player on your website. Please refer to <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1406723-mp4-video-embed">Embedding JW Player</a> to get learn how to embed a basic player.</li>
	<li>A working ad tag from an ad server, in either VAST/VPAID or Google IMA format. Again, see <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1431638-ad-formats-reference" target="_blank">Supported Ad Formats</a> for details.</li>
</ul>

<h2>VAST Advertising</h2>

<p>JW Player&#39;s advertising features allow you to monetize&nbsp;your content with video ads. JW Player supports ads that are compliant with two of the leading ad frameworks &mdash; IAB&#39;s VAST 3.0 and VPAID 2.0 as well as ads that are managed with Google&#39;s Interactive Media Ads SDK.</p>

<p>To begin monetizing content all that is needed is a valid ad tag from your ad partner and a Player that has advertising turned on.</p>

<div class="tab-switch clearfix">
<ul class="tabs" data-options="scroll_to_content:false; deep_linking:true" data-tab="" role="tablist">
	<li class="tab-title active" role="presentation"><a aria-controls="dashboard" aria-selected="true" href="#dashboard" role="tab" tabindex="0">Dashboard</a></li>
	<li class="tab-title" role="presentation"><a aria-controls="code" aria-selected="false" href="#code" role="tab" tabindex="0">Code</a></li>
</ul>

<div class="tabs-content">
<section aria-hidden="false" class="content active" id="dashboard" role="tabpanel">
<p>Using the JW Player dashboard, you can associate an ad tag to a particular player. This allows you publish the same ad tag with specific player settings alongside any number of videos. You can easily create a side-rail ads player as well as main content ads player.</p>

<h2>Creating an Ads Player</h2>
<img src="//support-static.jwplayer.com/images/advertising/ads-pane.png" style="float:right; margin:0px 0px 15px 15px;" width="300px" />
<ol>
	<li>Navigate to the Players section in your Dashboard.</li>
	<li>Click New Player or edit an existing Player.</li>
	<li>Set your desired playback settings and other customizations.</li>
	<li>Open the Advertising pane on the left-hand-side.</li>
	<li>Turn Advertising on.</li>
	<li>Choose the type of ad tag that you would like to associate with this player.
	<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
		<li>VAST uses JW Player&#39;s own ad tag parser</li>
		<li>Google IMA uses Google&#39;s IMA SDK</li>
		<li>VMAP is an external ad schedule</li>
		<li>JW Player schedule is an advanced schedule that allows you to associate pre, mid, and post rolls with this player.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Enter the tag URL or URL to your VMAP file in the URL field.</li>
	<li>Set the text for the user interface elements that you desire.
	<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
		<li>Message for while the ad is playing.</li>
		<li>Cue text - the tooltip over the controlbar cuepoint.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

<h2>Publishing Your Ads Player</h2>

<p>Now that you have an ads player, all you need to do is publish it with content. Choose your media from the Video List page and click Embed. On the Generate Embed Code dialog, select&nbsp;your ads player.You can also take the cloud-hosted player url for the player and place it on the page where you need an ads player.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Navigate to Content.</li>
	<li>Press the <img src="//support-static.jwplayer.com/images/advertising/embed.png" width="40px" />button for the video you want to publish.</li>
	<li>Make sure your Ads player is chosen. If not click CHANGE and select a new player.</li>
	<li>You can preview your ads on the Preview Page.</li>
	<li>Choose JavaScript or iFrame embed and copy the code to place on your page.</li>
</ol>
<img alt="" src="/customer/portal/attachments/714271" style="width: 690px; height: 468px;" />
<h3>Skipping</h3>

<p>You can enable a &lsquo;Skip Ad&rsquo; interface element during ad playback and even customize the countdown message as well as the skip text. Enabling skipping provides better engagement for your viewers. Note that ads that have VAST 3.0 skipoffset in the response use the skip offset from the tag and not from your player settings. Enable skipping to provide better engagement.</p>

<h3>Companion Ads</h3>

<p>JW Player supports the insertion of companion ads into the page. HTML/IFRAME and GIF/JPG/PNG ads are supported for both VAST and IMA.</p>
<img src="//support-static.jwplayer.com/images/advertising/companion.png" style="float:right; margin:0px 0px 15px 15px;" width="300px" />
<p>In order to render a companion, you must set the id, width and height of the DOM element the companion should be placed into. JW Player will then insert a companion if the ad tag contains one that exactly matches the width and height provided in the configuration. If the dimensions do not match up, JW Player will not display an ad. (which could lead to broken page designs)</p>
</section>

<section aria-hidden="true" class="content" id="code" role="tabpanel">
<p>Once your player is configured with desired options and playback behavior, it&#39;s time to set up your advertising. Ads are specified in the <strong>advertising</strong> configuration block. Inside, two options are required for a basic preroll ad to appear:</p>

<dl>
	<dt><strong>client</strong></dt>
	<dd>Set this to <strong>vast</strong> if you are running VAST/VPAID ads, or to <strong>googima</strong> if you are running Google IMA ads. Note you cannot mix both ad formats in a single player embed. Choosing a client will maintain the same client until the player is set up again.<br />
	Example: <strong>&#39;client&#39;: &#39;googima&#39;</strong> or <strong>&#39;client&#39;: &#39;vast&#39;</strong></dd>
	<dt><strong>tag</strong></dt>
	<dd>Set this to the URL of the ad tag that contains the pre-roll ad. Only linear ads can be run as pre-rolls; if you want to run e.g. an overlay you need to set a schedule (more info below).</dd>
	<dt><strong>skipoffset</strong></dt>
	<dd>Set this to a numerical amount of time you want an ad to be watched before it can be skipped. More information on ad skipping is located <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1433818-configuring-ad-skipping">here</a>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In addition to these two options, the <strong>schedule</strong>, <strong>companiondiv</strong> and <strong>admessage</strong> options are available for more elaborate setups which are discussed later on.</p>
<a name="vast"></a>

<h3>VAST Example</h3>

<p>First, here is a basic advertising setup using a VAST/VPAID pre-roll:</p>

<pre>
var playerInstance = jwplayer(&#39;myElement&#39;);
playerInstance.setup({
  file: &#39;assets/myVideo.mp4&#39;,
  primary: &#39;flash&#39;,
  advertising: {
    client: &#39;vast&#39;,
    tag: &#39;//adserver.com/vastResponse.xml&#39;
  }
});
</pre>

<h3>Demo</h3>

<div class="cont" id="vastContainer">&nbsp;</div>
<script>
var playerInstance = jwplayer("vastContainer");
playerInstance.setup({
  image: "//s1-www.ltvimg.com/cdn/farfuture/A4Ot5zIiiX6I0zhJTvqF9xyAg6frFcAuXu3YpmtQUzc/mtime:1388777784/sites/default/files/vast-preoll.png",
  file: "//content.jwplatform.com/videos/bkaovAYt-640.mp4",
width: '75%',
aspectratio: '16:9',
  advertising: {
    client: "vast",
    tag: "//s3.amazonaws.com/demo.jwplayer.com/player-demos/assets/preroll.xml"
  }
});
</script> <a name="googima"></a>

<h2>Google IMA Preroll</h2>

<p>Here is an example of a setup of JW Player with a TrueView pre-roll advertisement served by Google IMA:</p>

<pre>
var playerInstance = jwplayer(&#39;myElement&#39;);
playerInstance.setup({
  file: &#39;assets/myVideo.mp4&#39;,
  primary: &#39;flash&#39;,
  advertising: {
    client: &#39;googima&#39;,
    tag: &#39;//ad.doubleclick.net/pfadx/ABCDEFGH&#39;
  }
});
</pre>

<h3>Demo</h3>

<div class="cont" id="GoogimaContainer">&nbsp;</div>
<script>
var playerInstance2 = jwplayer("GoogimaContainer");
playerInstance2.setup({
  image: "/customer/portal/attachments/268082",
  file: "//content.jwplatform.com/videos/bkaovAYt-kNspJqnJ.mp4",
width: '75%',
aspectratio: '16:9',
  advertising: {
    client: "googima",
    tag: "//pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x360&iu=/6062/iab_vast_samples/skippable&ciu_szs=300x250,728x90&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&env=vp&output=xml_vast2&unviewed_position_start=1&url=[referrer_url]&correlator=[timestamp]"
  }
});
</script>

<p>Note that VAST and IMA ads don&#39;t require Flash, but we strongly recommend to set it as the <strong>primary</strong> rendering mode. Many ad servers (CORS) and creatives (FLV) are not yet compatible with HTML5. In addition,&nbsp;JW Player only supports VPAID ads in Flash. This ensures that a user viewing with Flash installed will receive the advertisement.</p>

<h2>A note on Google IMA and iPhones</h2>

<p>As per Google IMA guidelines, if ad skipping is configured for a particular ad, Google will not display this advertisement on iPhone devices. Since fullscreen video is utilized for video ads, and there is no way to instantiate an ad skip, the advertisement will be omitted.</p>

 Below is the article formerly called "Video Ads in JW Platform" located at http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1483106-video-ads-in-jw-platform


It is to be turned into a "dashboard" section alongside the above content.

Ask Shannon for details about this.




<p>Advertising is a key component of online video and a core strength of JW Player. That&#39;s why <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/products/jwplatform/" target="_blank">JW Platform</a> includes full support for setting Video Ads in your players. Here is a live example, playing a pre-roll VAST ad:</p>

<div id="myElement">&nbsp;</div>
<script type="text/javascript">
jwplayer("myElement").setup({
  advertising: {"companiondiv": {"width": 300, "id": "companion", "height": 250}, "client": "vast", "tag": "http://demo.jwplayer.com/static-tag/preroll.xml", "admessage": "Ad: your video starts in xx seconds"},
  displaytitle: false,
  height: 270,
  playlist: "http://content.jwplatform.com/jw6/bkaovAYt.xml",
  plugins: {"http://assets-jpcust.jwpsrv.com/player/6/6124956/ping.js": {"pixel": "http://content.jwplatform.com/ping.gif"}},
  primary: "flash",
  stretching: "uniform",
  width: 480
});
</script>

<p>This article explains what formats are supported and how ads are setup. Note that advertising in JW Platform is only available for publishers who also purchased <strong>JW Ads</strong>. Please contact us if you are interested in advertising, but don&#39;t have a JW Ads license yet.</p>

<div class="article_callout">This document applies to users of <strong>JW Platform and Ads</strong>. Don&#39;t have Hosting or Ads? <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/pricing/">Upgrade Now</a>.</div>

<h2>Supported Ad Formats</h2>

<p>JW Platform offers support for 4 different ad configurations:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>VAST/VPAID Pre-roll</dt>
	<dd>This sets a single pre-roll ad, served by a VAST-compliant video ad server (nearly any ad server today). See our <a href="/blog/26790/vast-vpaid-standardizing-online-video-ads/">VAST/VPAID blog post</a> for some background info.</dd>
	<dt>Google IMA Pre-roll</dt>
	<dd>This sets a single pre-roll ad, served through the <a href="http://developers.google.com/interactive-media-ads/">Interactive Media Ads</a> (IMA) SDK version 3. LongTail Video is one of Google&#39;s official video technology partners.</dd>
	<dt>VMAP Ad Schedule</dt>
	<dd>This sets a full ad schedule, which can consist of multiple pre-, mid- and post-roll ad breaks. Since VMAP is a fairly new standard, not many video ad servers yet support it. Google&#39;s Dart For Publishers (DFP) is one of the adservers that does support VMAP.</dd>
	<dt>VAST Tag with Fallbacks(Waterfall)</dt>
	<dd>This option allows for the configuration of up to three VAST ad tags. JW Platform will then attempt to play each of these tags, in order, until an impression is delivered. If all three tags fail to deliver an impression, your video content will begin. For more information regarding VAST tag waterfalling, see our document <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1665150-ad-tag-waterfalling" target="_blank">here</a>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>See the <a href="/customer/portal/articles/1431638-supported-ad-formats">Supported Ad Formats</a> article for more details, a list of verified VAST ad servers and a list of supported VAST tag variables.</p>

<h2>Advertising Setup</h2>

<p>All advertising options are set in the <strong>Advertising</strong> tab of the player setup pages in the dashboard:</p>

<p><img alt="the Dashboard player advertising options." src="/customer/portal/attachments/257547" /></p>

<p>In addition to providing the URL to your VAST, IMA or VMAP tag, you can set the following properties:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A custom <strong>Ad Message</strong>, displayed in the controlbar during ad playback.</li>
	<li>The ability to <strong>Skip Ads</strong> after a certain amount of seconds. This enables you to balance the interests of advertisers and viewers.</li>
	<li>The location to insert a <strong>Companion Ad</strong> into. Companions are only inserted when the ad tag has a creative that matches the provided dimensions.</li>
</ul>

<p>For VMAP schedules, JW Player will automatically render <strong>Ad Markers</strong> on the controlbar, to signal to viewers where mid-roll ad breaks are located.</p>

<div id="keyvalues">&nbsp;</div>

<h2>Key Value Pairs with VAST or Googima Tags</h2>

<p>Key Value pairs within JW Platform require two pieces to be configured within our platform. These are:</p>

<ol>
	<li><a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1469776-uploading-videos#custom">Metadata for video objects</a>&nbsp;to associate key words with videos</li>
	<li><a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1434340-ad-tag-variables#playlist">Custom ad tag variables</a>&nbsp;to reference the metadata in item 1</li>
</ol>

<p>Once properly configured, we are able to extract custom playlist information from video objects in the platform, and append this to an ad tag request. In the below example, we&#39;ve gone into our video object and edited our custom metadata as follows:<br />
â€‹</p>
<img src="http://support-static.jwplayer.com/images/meta.png" />
<p>Now, when inputting our ad tag into the advertising section of a player configuration, we can&nbsp;use variables to reference this data:</p>

<pre>
http://mysite.com/adtag.xml/?sport=__item-sport__&amp;age=__item-age__
</pre>

<p>When our video is played, will replace the variables which we&#39;ve specified above with our inputted playlist information:</p>

<pre>
http://mysite.com/adtag.xml/?sport=soccer&amp;age=kids
</pre>
