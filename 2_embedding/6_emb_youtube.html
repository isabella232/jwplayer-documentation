<p>JW Player uses the official <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/iframe_api_reference">iFrame player API</a> from YouTube to play a video inside of JW Player. This means that <strong>HTML5 is the only supported method of Youtube playback in JW7</strong>.<br />
Several YouTube features, like the preview image and quality selection, are supported as well. Note that since the video file is being hosted via Youtube, there are certain limitations. These limitations include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>YouTube watermark cannot be removed</li>
  <li>YouTube advertisements inside of videos cannot be removed</li>
  <li>JW Player&#39;s advertising plugins cannot be used.</li>
  <li>Skins will not appear initially on mobile.</li>
  <li>YouTube playlists and/or RSS feeds are unsupported</li>
  <li>HTML5 is the only supported method of playback</li>
  <li>Mobile devices require user interactions to start video playback. This means that playlists do not work seamlessly on mobile.</li>
</ul>

<p>YouTube videos are embedded by linking to their page via the <strong>file</strong> setup option, using one of the following schemes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylLzyHk54Z0">//www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylLzyHk54Z0</a></li>
  <li><a href="//www.youtube.com/v/ylLzyHk54Z0">//www.youtube.com/v/ylLzyHk54Z0</a></li>
  <li><a href="//youtu.be/ylLzyHk54Z0">//youtu.be/ylLzyHk54Z0</a></li>
</ul>

<p>An example of a Youtube embed can be seen below:</p>

<div id="container">&nbsp;</div>
<script>
var playerInstance = jwplayer("container");
playerInstance.setup({
file: "//www.youtube.com/watch?v=YE7VzlLtp-4",
width: 640,
height: 360
});
</script>

<h2>Embedding Step-by-Step</h2>

<p>Above, we have embedded a JW Player to show its functions and appearance. However, to embed a player on your own web page, please see the following steps:</p>

<h3>Step 1: Configuring your JW Player Library</h3>

<p>JW Player offers two options for configuring your player&#39;s library on your web page:</p>

<h3>Option A: Add a library to your &lt;head&gt;</h3>

<p>In order to embed media with JW Player, you first have to add the player library to the head of your HTML page(or elsewhere above the actual embed). Player libraries are found in your embedding wizard and will set player defaults according to what is specified in the Wizard. A player&#39;s library will appear similarly to:</p>

<pre>
&lt;script src=&quot;//content.jwplatform.com/libraries/eX4mp13.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The above library can be reached via HTTPS by changing <strong>http</strong> to <strong>https</strong> in the URL</p>

<p>JW Player libraries are cloud-hosted by us, making them fast, reliable, secure, and always up-to-date with our latest releases. In addition, all configuration is performed with our easy-to-use graphical interface via our Dashboard.</p>

<h3>Option B: Self-hosting</h3>

<p>If you want to host your own player library, you can find both your license key and latest JW Player files in your dashboard&#39;s <a href="https://dashboard.jwplayer.com/#/account/advanced">Advanced Account</a> page. Once downloaded, you will need to host jwplayer.js on your own server. When configuring your web page, you will then need to point to your copy of jwplayer.js <strong>and</strong> also define your self-hosted license key. Here&#39;s a code example:</p>

<pre>
â€‹&lt;script src=&quot;//mywebsite.com/jwplayer/jwplayer.js&quot; &gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;jwplayer.key=&quot;ABCdeFG123456SeVenABCdeFG123456SeVen==&quot;;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>JW Player 7 now <strong>requires</strong> a license key. Please make sure to include this on your page if you are self-hosting.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Add the embed code to your &lt;body&gt;</h3>

<p>With the player library set up, it&#39;s time to actually embed the video. You can insert this HTML in your page, at the exact location you want the video to appear:</p>

<pre>
&lt;div id=&quot;myElement&quot;&gt;Loading the player...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
var playerInstance = jwplayer(&quot;myElement&quot;);
playerInstance.setup({
file: &quot;//www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CjdLYBDUqw&quot;,
width: 640,
height: 360
});
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<h3>Step 3: Configuration</h3>

<p>In this above code, the &lt;div&gt; element is used as a container to load JW Player into, which must have a unique <strong>id</strong> attribute. The setup() block then refers to this ID. However, let&#39;s break down each of the configuration options to see what is being affected:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>file - </strong>Which youtube video we&#39;ll be loading with JW Player</li>
  <li><strong>width - </strong>The width of the video player in pixels</li>
  <li><strong>height - </strong> The height of the player, also in pixels. Setting this to <strong>40</strong> or lower will put the player into <strong>Audio Mode</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>Now that you have configured a basic player embed, you can start looking into adding further customizations. See the <a href="/customer/portal/topics/601064-customization/articles">Customization section</a> for more information.</p>
