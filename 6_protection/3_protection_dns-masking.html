<p>This article explains what DNS masking is and how to DNS mask the JW Platform content servers (<em>content.jwplatform.com</em>)</p>

<div class="article_callout">This document applies to users of <strong>JW Platform</strong>. Don&#39;t have Hosting? <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/pricing/">Upgrade Now</a>.</div>

<h2>What is DNS masking?</h2>

<p>With DNS masking you can make it look like the JW Platform embed codes are part of your domain instead of hosted on a third party service. People looking in your HTML code will see e.g. <em>cdn.example.com</em> instead of <em>content.jwplatform.com</em>.</p>

<p>It also means that, if you have enabled the sharing plugin, the shared embed codes will contain your own domain name. This looks more professional towards your customers.</p>

<p>Player embeds (script, iframe, embed), preview thumbnails, RSS feeds and video downloads all benefit from DNS Masking.</p>

<h2>1: Setup a DNS Mask</h2>

<p>Technically, DNS masking is accomplished by setting up a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record">CNAME record</a>. <strong>You have to do this yourself</strong> with the company that manages your domain name. We cannot do this for you.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Note you do not have to use a subdomain called <em>content</em>. You can use any string (e.g. <em>video</em> or <em>cdn</em>).</li>
	<li>Also note the record type should be <strong>CNAME</strong>.</li>
	<li>Last, the <em>dot</em> after content.jwplatform.com. is <strong>required</strong>. Don&#39;t forget it!</li>
</ul>

<p>It can take up to a couple of hours for the new CNAME record to propagate. Once it has completed you should see your data load if you replace our domain name with yours. <a href="http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/nPripu9l-120.jpg">Here&#39;s a simple example image to test</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>2: Register a DNS Mask</h2>

<p>Once the DNS mask is active, you should submit it to our dashboard, so we can start using the mask for your account. The DNS Mask option can be found in the <strong>Account</strong> section of the dashboard:</p>

<p><img alt="DNS Mask Account Property" src="/customer/portal/attachments/239119" /></p>

<p>With the DNS mask registered with us:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The embed codes in all publish dialogs in the dashboard (players, downloads, feeds) will then use your domain.</li>
	<li>The embed codes in the <em>sharing</em> dialog in your players will then use your domain.</li>
</ul>

<p>After having entered the DNS mask in the Dashboard, you&#39;re all set!</p>
