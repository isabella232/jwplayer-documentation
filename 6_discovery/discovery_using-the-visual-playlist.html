<p>This article covers the way that JW Player's interface behaves when playing playlist content. For more about playlist content, read "<a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1481963">Building &amp; Managing Playlists</a>". </p>
<p>When playing back a playlist, JW Player 7 automatically includes a <strong>visual playlist</strong> button on the player's control bar. Mousing over (or touching) this button will display the playlist items in a scrollable overlay (the "Visual Playlist"). This allows a user to quickly jump between various playlist items. Visual Playlists are rendered entirely on top of the player, without the need for additional space next to (or below) the player.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Visual Playlist Example</h3>

<p>The below is an example of what a visual playlist looks like by default in a JW Player (in this example, an RSS playlist is the content referenced in the player setup code). The player populates the visual playlist automatically with the title of each item (as specified in the dashboard, or in the embed block itself).</p>

<div id="container">&nbsp;</div>
<script>
var playerInstance = jwplayer("container");
playerInstance.setup({
  playlist: "//content.jwplatform.com/feeds/13ShtP5m.rss",
  width: "70%",
  aspectratio: "16:9"
});
</script>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Example Embed Code</h3>

<pre>
&lt;div id=&quot;myElement&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
var playerInstance = jwplayer(&quot;myElement&quot;);
    playerInstance.setup({
      playlist: &quot;/uploads/myPlaylist.rss&quot;
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Show or Hide the Visual Playlist</h2>
<p>While the Visual Playlist is enabled by default, it can also be hidden. When you're setting up your player in the Player Builder page of the dashboard, you'll want to make sure the "Show visual playlist tools" button is un-checked. Click "Save", and you'll see your changes reflected if the player is already embedded.</p>
<p><img src="//support-static.jwplayer.com/images/discovery/playlist-settings-player-builder.png" alt="Hide or Show Visual Playlist in the Player Builder"/></p>

<p>The visual playlist can be turned off on the embed level by setting <strong>visualplaylist</strong> to <strong>false</strong> within the configuration setup. (This setting is <strong>true</strong> by default).

<!-- REPLACED 4/7 

<p>This article explains how to easily display the contents of your playlist with JW Player 7&#39;s integrated visual playlist feature.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>When using a playlist in any format(setup, xml, RSS) JW Player 7 will automatically include a visual playlist button on its control bar. Mousing over (or touching) this button will display a visual playlist, allowing a user to quickly jump between particular playlist items. Visual playlists are now rendered entirely over the player, without the need for additional vertical or horizontal space.</p>

<p>The visual playlist can be turned off by setting <strong>visualplaylist</strong> to false within the configuration setup. This is true by default.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The below is an example of the player&#39;s default handling of a visual playlist. The only thing specified in this case is an RSS playlist. The player will then populate the visual playlist automatically with the specified titles of each item.</p>

<div id="container">&nbsp;</div>
<script>
var playerInstance = jwplayer("container");
playerInstance.setup({
  playlist: "//content.jwplatform.com/feeds/13ShtP5m.rss",
  width: "70%",
  aspectratio: "16:9"
});
</script>

<h2>Embed code</h2>

<pre>
&lt;div id=&quot;myElement&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
var playerInstance = jwplayer(&quot;myElement&quot;);
    playerInstance.setup({
      playlist: &quot;/uploads/myPlaylist.rss&quot;
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<h2>Customizing the Visual Playlist with CSS</h2>

<p>The default style of the visual playlist has a maximum height. This is so it does not take up the entire height of the player. The visual playlist can be easily customized with CSS.</p>

<p>Here is some CSS you can add on your page or adjust directly in your self-hosted seven.css to make the visual playlist wider and as tall as the player.</p>

<pre>
/*Sets the visual listbar width to 400 px and realigns it above the icon. */
 .jw-skin-seven .jw-overlay .jw-playlist-container {
 	width:400px;
 	left:-20%;
 }

/* overrides the player settings for how tall the visualplaylist can be. 195px is the about right for a player that is 270px tall, including the controlbar height, and menus. */
.jwplayer .jw-playlist {
min-height: none;
max-height: none;
height: 195px;

 }

/* Makes it so the list items are left aligned in the visualplaylist */
 .jwplayer .jw-playlist .jw-option {
	padding: 0 15px;
	margin: auto;
	text-align: left;
}


</pre>

<div id="container2">&nbsp;</div>
<script>
var playerInstance = jwplayer("container2");
playerInstance.setup({
  playlist: "//content.jwplatform.com/feeds/13ShtP5m.rss",
  aspectratio: "16:9",
  skin:{
    name:"seven-2",
    url:"//s3.amazonaws.com/demo.jwplayer.com/visualplaylist/seven2.css"
    },
});
</script>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Creating Your Own Custom Sidebar</h2>

<p>If you are looking to do some additional customization work on a playlist sidebar, it is possible to create your own with our API and some CSS work. An example of this can be seen <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1543546-example-making-your-own-playlist-sidebar" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
