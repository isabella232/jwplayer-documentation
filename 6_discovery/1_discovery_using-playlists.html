<p>This article walks through the ways in which Playlists can be used to play content with JW Player. Mastery of the "Playlists" concept will give you greater control over your JW Player embeds and the content you publish for your users.</p>
<p>For more information about the types of content can be used in a JW Player embed, read about <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1403635">supported formats</a> and <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1406723">basic embedding</a>. </p>

<h2>About Playlists</h2>
<p>Playlists are lists of one or more pieces of content that can be played, in order, in a JW Player. Playlist objects can either be created <a href="#dash">in the dashboard</a>, coded <a href="#code">by hand</a> in a player setup block, or referenced <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1406722">externally</a> via an RSS feed, XML file, or JSON feed.</p>

<p>When using a Playlist, JW Player 7 automatically includes a visual playlist button on the player's control bar. Mousing over (or touching) this button will display the Playlist items in a scrollable overlay (the "Visual Playlist"). This allows a user to quickly jump between various playlist items. Visual Playlists are rendered entirely on top of the player, without the need for additional space next to (or below) the player.</p>

<h3>Visual Playlist Example</h3>

<p>The below is an example of what a visual playlist looks like by default in a JW Player (in this example, an RSS playlist is the content referenced in the player setup code). The player populates the Visual Playlist automatically with the title of each item (as specified in the dashboard, or in the embed block itself).</p>

<div id="container">&nbsp;</div>
<script>
var playerInstance = jwplayer("container");
playerInstance.setup({
  playlist: "//content.jwplatform.com/feeds/13ShtP5m.rss",
  width: "70%",
  aspectratio: "16:9"
});
</script>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Embed code</h3>

<pre>
&lt;div id=&quot;myElement&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
var playerInstance = jwplayer(&quot;myElement&quot;);
    playerInstance.setup({
      playlist: &quot;/uploads/myPlaylist.rss&quot;
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Visual Playlist is enabled automatically, but it can also be hidden. For more about hiding the Visual Playlist controls, skip to the corresponding <a href="#hide-in-dash">Dashboard</a> or <a href="#hide-in-code">Code</a> sections below. </p>

<h2>DASHBOARD</h2>
</a>

<p>In the JW Player dashboard, playlist creation &amp; management happens in the <em>Playlists</em> <a href="https://dashboard.jwplayer.com/#/content/playlists" target="_blank">section</a>:</p>

<p><img src="//support-static.jwplayer.com/images/discovery/playlist-management-list.png" alt="playlists section overview page" /></p>


</a>
<a name="Manual-vs-Dynamic">
<h2>Manual vs. Dynamic Playlists</h2>
</a>
<p>There are two types of playlists that can be created in the dashboard. They each behave differently, and the differences between them are important. 
<ul>
	<li><strong>Manual</strong> playlists are populated by dragging &amp; dropping videos into the playlist. Manual playlists don&#39;t change after they're created unless you change them, and they do not automatically get updated.</li>
	<li><strong>Dynamic</strong> playlists are automatically populated based upon rules. For example, you can create a playlist that follows this rules: <em>Include all videos that are tagged with <strong>Cat</strong></em>. If you tag another video with <strong>Cat</strong>, it would automatically be added to this playlist.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<a name="Creating-Playlist-Dashboard">
<h2>Creating a Playlist</h2>
<p>Click the blue <em>New Playlist</em> button to create a new playlist. The dropdown arrow on the right side of this button will allow you to select between the two types of playlists. </p>




<p>Note: make sure you have a couple of videos in your account already, otherwise there will be no content to put inside your playlist.</p>

<h2>Managing Playlists</h2>

<p>Once a playlist is created, you can view the detail page of that playlist. Here is a screenshot of the detail page for a <em>dynamic</em> playlist (the <em>manual</em> playlist detail page has a similar layout):</p>
 <p><img alt="dynamic playlist detail page" src="//support-static.jwplayer.com/images/discovery/playlist-detail-dynamic.png" /></p>

<p>On this page, you can manage all aspects of a playlist, including:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The metadata of the playlist, like its <em>title</em> and <em>description</em>.</li>
	<li>For <strong>Dynamic</strong> playlists: The rules for populating the playlist, like the tags to use, the sorting method and the maximum length.</li>
	<li>For <strong>Manual</strong> playlists: Searching and adding new videos by dragging them from the search results.</li>
	<li>The current lineup of the playlist. For <strong>Dynamic</strong> playlist, this is purely informational. For <strong>Manual</strong> playlists, you can also re-order or delete videos here.</li>
</ol>

<a name="Publishing a Playlist in the Dashboard">
<h2>Publishing a Playlist</h2>
</a>

<p>There are two ways to publish playlists from the dashboard. The simplest one is by publishing it in an existing JW Player from your account. Do this by hitting the <em>Embed</em> button in the left sidebar of the Playlist detail page. This will expand Publish Mode:</p>

<p><img alt="playlist in publish mode" src="//support-static.jwplayer.com/images/discovery/playlist-publish-mode.png" /></p>

<p>Here, you'll see the last player used to publish a video. If you'd like, select a different player you want to use. (Note: this is the same publishing flow outlined in our <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1406723">Basic Embedding</a> article). Preview your playlist in the selected player before embedding by clicking the "preview" button.</p>
<a name="hide-in-dash">
<h2>Show or Hide the Visual Playlist</h2>
<p><p>While the Visual Playlist is enabled by default, it can also be hidden. When you're setting up your player in the Player Builder page of the dashboard, you'll want to make sure the "Show visual playlist tools" button is un-checked. Click "Save", and you'll see your changes reflected if the player is already embedded.</p>
 </p>
<p><img src="//support-static.jwplayer.com/images/discovery/playlist-settings-player-builder.png" alt="Hide or Show Visual Playlist in the Player Builder"/></p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Feeds</h3>
<p>The other way to publish or your playlist is through a Feed. Feeds are valuable for syndication of your video content to partners for use or publication elsewhere. Feeds contain all the metadata and media links needed to play your videos.</p>
<p>Both RSS and JSON feed URLs can be found in the "sources" tab of a playlist detail page.</p>
<img src="//support-static.jwplayer.com/images/discovery/playlist-detail-sources-tab.png" alt="Playlist Detail Sources Tab"/>

<p>For more about RSS and JSON Feeds, and how to embed them, read our article on <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1406722">external feeds</a>.  

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="code">
<h2>CODE</h2>
</a>
<p>Above, we included an example of what happens when an RSS feed is used as playlist content in an embed. (For more about embedding external feeds, read our <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1406722">article on the topic</a>).</p>  
<p>It's also possible to use single items of content and configure a playlist with them, directly inside a JW Player embed.</p>
<a name="Building a Playlist in the Embed Block">
<h2>Building a Playlist Directly in the Embed Block</h2>
</a>
<p>Understanding how a player functions with a single item is integral to understanding how to properly create a multi-item playlst. A single item is used here:</p>

<pre>
var playerInstance = jwplayer(&quot;player&quot;);
playerInstance.setup({
  file: &#39;myvideo.mp4&#39;,
  image: &#39;myposter.png&#39;,
  title: &#39;My Video&#39;,
  mediaid: &#39;123456&#39;
});
</pre>

<h3>A Single Item Playlist</h3>
<p>Above, we&#39;ve configured only one single piece of content (an mp4 file) within the player&mdash; with a file, poster image, and title. However, let&#39;s say that we want to <em>create</em> a single-item playlist. In this case, rather than specifying a file, image, and title directly, we&#39;ll be inserting these into a &quot;playlist&quot; config block as a playlist item. Let&#39;s look at the above code in the context of a playlist:</p>
<pre>
playerInstance.setup({
playlist: [{
  file: &#39;myvideo.mp4&#39;,
  image: &#39;myposter.png&#39;,
  title: &#39;My Video&#39;,
  mediaid: &#39;123456&#39;
}]
});
</pre>

<p>Again, since we&#39;re listing this as a single playlist item, both of our code snippets will behave exactly the same way. However, using the playlist block allows us to easily insert additional playlist items if needed.<br />
For reference, the formatting for a playlist is as follows:</p>

<pre>
playlist: [{}, {}, ...]
</pre>

<h3>A two-item playlist</h3>

<p>So, with the above in mind, let&#39;s add a second video item&nbsp;to our playlist:</p>

<pre>
playerInstance.setup({
playlist: [{
  file: &#39;myvideo.mp4&#39;,
  image: &#39;myposter.png&#39;,
  title: &#39;My Video&#39;,
  mediaid: &#39;123456&#39;
},
{
  file: &#39;mysecondvideo.mp4&#39;,
  image: &#39;mysecondposter.png&#39;,
  title: &#39;My Second Video&#39;,
  mediaid: &#39;234567&#39;
}]
});
</pre>

<p>Awesome! We now have two items in our playlist.</p>

<h3>A three-item playlist... and beyond</h3>

<p>Any additional playlist items will follow the same convention as above. Each item (meaning a file, image, and title) will exist within {curly} brackets, separated by a comma, and all will be fully contained within a single set of [square brackets], similar to an array. Just for clarity, three playlist items would appear as:</p>

<pre>
playerInstance.setup({
playlist: [{
  file: &#39;myvideo.mp4&#39;,
  image: &#39;myposter.png&#39;,
  title: &#39;My Video&#39;,
  mediaid: &#39;123456&#39;
},
{
  file: &#39;mysecondvideo.mp4&#39;,
  image: &#39;mysecondposter.png&#39;,
  title: &#39;My Second Video&#39;,
  mediaid: &#39;234567&#39;
},
{
  file: &#39;mythirdvideo.mp4&#39;,
  image: &#39;mythirdposter.png&#39;,
  title: &#39;My Third Video&#39;,
  mediaid: &#39;345678&#39;
}]
});
</pre>

<p>Any configuration options after a playlist will still require a comma after the second square bracket similar to:</p>

<pre>
playerInstance.setup({
playlist: [{
  file: &#39;myvideo.mp4&#39;,
  image: &#39;myposter.png&#39;,
  title: &#39;My Video&#39;,
  mediaid: &#39;123456&#39;
},
{
  file: &#39;mysecondvideo.mp4&#39;,
  image: &#39;mysecondposter.png&#39;,
  title: &#39;My Second Video&#39;,
  mediaid: &#39;234567&#39;
},
{
  file: &#39;mythirdvideo.mp4&#39;,
  image: &#39;mythirdposter.png&#39;,
  title: &#39;My Third Video&#39;,
  mediaid: &#39;345678&#39;
}],
primary: &#39;flash&#39;
});
</pre>

<p>So again, this is still allowed, just keep the additional comma in mind when embedding!</p>

<h2>Sources with a playlist</h2>

<p>Lasty, it is entirely possible to create a playlist item that has multiple sources (Either using multiple qualities or fallbacks) in conjunction with our article <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1710454-configuring-multiple-sources">here</a>. You&#39;ll need to nest your sources block in place of&nbsp;&quot;file&quot;&nbsp;within the playlist item. So a quick example of the structure would look like:</p>

<pre>
playerInstance.setup({
    playlist: [{
        sources: [{source1},{source2},{source3}, ...],
        image: &#39;myposter.png&#39;,
        title: &#39;My Video&#39;,
        mediaid: &#39;123456&#39;
},{
        sources: [{source1},{source2},{source3}, ...],
        image: &#39;mysecondposter.png&#39;,
        title: &#39;My Second Video&#39;,
        mediaid: &#39;234567&#39;
},{
        sources: [{source1},{source2},{source3}, ...],
        image: &#39;mythirdposter.png&#39;,
        title: &#39;My Third Video&#39;,
        mediaid: &#39;345678&#39;
}],
});
</pre>

<p>An actual example of how this would look with 3 different sources per playlist item:</p>

<pre>
playerInstance.setup({
playlist: [{
     sources: [{ 
            file: &quot;myFile.flv&quot;
        },{ 
            file: &quot;myFile.mp4&quot;
        },{
            file: &quot;myFile.webm&quot;
        }],
     image: &#39;image.jpg&#39;,
     title: &#39;This is a multisource video!&#39;,
     mediaid: &#39;123456&#39;
},{
     sources: [{ 
            file: &quot;myFile2.flv&quot;
        },{ 
            file: &quot;myFile2.mp4&quot;
        },{
            file: &quot;myFile2.webm&quot;
        }],
     image: &#39;image2.jpg&#39;,
     title: &#39;This is another multisource video!&#39;,
     mediaid: &#39;234567&#39;
},{
     sources: [{ 
            file: &quot;myFile3.flv&quot;
        },{ 
            file: &quot;myFile3.mp4&quot;
        },{
            file: &quot;myFile3.webm&quot;
        

</pre>
