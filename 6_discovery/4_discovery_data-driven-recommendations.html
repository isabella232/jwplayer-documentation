<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>A select group of Ads &amp; Enterprise customers who use the related video feature are a part of our Data Driven Recommendations Beta.</p>

<p>Customers with unlimited hosting and streaming, who use single line embeds with the JW7 player, and who are not using content signing will automatically receive Data Driven Recommendations when they build a player and configure it to use the related plugin.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<p><strong>What are Data-Driven Recommendations?</strong></p>

<p>JW Player analyzes audience interactions and key content attributes for your entire published video library to build powerful contextual recommendations. When you enable the &ldquo;Related Videos&rdquo; feature for a given player, videos determined to be interesting to the user are displayed in our redesigned related plugin overlay.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These customized recommendations are dynamically updated based on viewer activity and published content. The underlying algorithms and technology behind our recommendations system are continually being improved to provide the best possible experience for your viewers and to drive the deepest engagement possible with your content.</p>

<p><strong>Why is this a &lsquo;beta&rsquo;?</strong></p>

<p>We are giving this product a &#39;beta&#39; designation so that our users know to expect functionality changes, improvements, and possibly bugs at a different rate than a full production ready product. We know our customers are very excited about data driven recommendations and we wanted to get both publishers and viewers using recommendations as soon as possible.</p>

<p>We hope you&#39;re as excited as we are to try this new feature and you can contact your account services representative with any feedback.</p>

<p><strong>What else should I know?</strong></p>

<p>There are some important things to keep in mind about beta recommendations:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>The recommender system works best with English language content, or more specifically English language metadata within the title and description fields.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Recommendations are limited to videos which are hosted by JW Player.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Some recommendations shown to users will take into consideration all videos and domains within an account. Therefore when some recommendations are displayed videos shown to the user might not be restricted to the domain on which they were initially published. This means that highly relevant videos from one of your domains might be recommended to viewers on another one of your domains.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>For some&nbsp;customers there might be a delay of up to a day for recommendations to appear when related feature is first enabled. This means that if you enable the related plugin and embed a player onto a page you might not see the related overlay until the following day.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Using recommendations with content signing turned on is not supported at this time. Turning on content signing after activating the related feature could cause unexpected behavior &mdash; though this should not affect the end viewer&rsquo;s experience.</p>
	</li>
</ol>
