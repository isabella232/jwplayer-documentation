<p>With Data-Driven Recommendations, JW Player analyzes audience interactions and key content attributes for your entire published video library to build powerful contextual video recommendations. When customers who meet correct criteria enable the &ldquo;Related Videos&rdquo; feature for a given player, videos determined to be interesting to the user are displayed in our related overlay.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These customized recommendations are dynamically updated based on viewer activity and published content. The underlying algorithms and technology behind our recommendations system are continually being improved to provide the best possible experience for your viewers and to drive the deepest engagement possible with your content.</p>

<p>Data-Driven Recommendations work with our <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1483102-related-videos">Related Videos</a> feature. Please read that article for full implementation instructions.</p>

<p><strong>You can turn on Data-Driven Recommendations when building a player if: </strong>
<ul>
<li>Your account has <a href="https://www.jwplayer.com/pricing/" target="_blank">High-Volume hosting &amp; Streaming</a></li>
<li>Your account does <strong>not</strong> use <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1433647" target="_blank">URL signing</a></li>
<li>You embed players via the dashboard-provided <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1406723" target="_blank">embed code</a></li>
<li>The player in question is a <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1403726" target="_blank">JW7</a> player</li>
</ul> </p>

<h2>Start Using Data-Driven Recommendations</h2>

<p>Sign in to the dashboard and navigate to a new or existing player. If your account fits the criteria listed above, recommendations will be enabled and you will see the related configuration panel in the player detail page.</p>
<p>Get a step-by-step guide to enabling Related Videos <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1409745">here</a>.</p>
<p>Go ahead&mdash;turn it on! To get the biggest boost in plays, enable "autoplay" (shown here).<br />

<br />
<span style="line-height: 20.8px;">After turning on recommendations, you will see a boost in plays from viewers who want to watch more content inline in the player.<br />
<br />
<span style="color:#FF0046;"><strong>Important note:</strong></span> In some cases, it can take up to two hours for our recommended content to appear in your player. (You may preview the related videos overlay immediately, but the quality of data-driven recommendations will greatly improve after the system has processed all your video content).</span>

<h3>What else should I know?</h3>

<p>There are some important things to keep in mind about beta recommendations:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>The recommender system works best with English language content, or more specifically English language metadata within the title and description fields.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Recommendations are limited to videos which are hosted by JW Player.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Some recommendations shown to users will take into consideration all videos and domains within an account. Therefore when some recommendations are displayed videos shown to the user might not be restricted to the domain on which they were initially published. This means that highly relevant videos from one of your domains might be recommended to viewers on another one of your domains.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Using recommendations with content signing turned on is not supported at this time. Turning on content signing after activating the related feature could cause unexpected behavior &mdash; though this should not affect the end viewer&rsquo;s experience.</p>
	</li>
