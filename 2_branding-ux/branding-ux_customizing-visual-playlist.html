<h2>Customizing the Visual Playlist with CSS</h2>

<p>The default style of the visual playlist has a maximum height. This is so it does not take up the entire height of the player. The visual playlist can be easily customized with CSS.</p>

<p>Here is some CSS you can add on your page or adjust directly in your self-hosted seven.css to make the visual playlist wider and as tall as the player.</p>

<pre>
/*Sets the visual listbar width to 400 px and realigns it above the icon. */
 .jw-skin-seven .jw-overlay .jw-playlist-container {
  width:400px;
  left:-20%;
 }

/* overrides the player settings for how tall the visualplaylist can be. 195px is the about right for a player that is 270px tall, including the controlbar height, and menus. */
.jwplayer .jw-playlist {
min-height: none;
max-height: none;
height: 195px;

 }

/* Makes it so the list items are left aligned in the visualplaylist */
 .jwplayer .jw-playlist .jw-option {
  padding: 0 15px;
  margin: auto;
  text-align: left;
}

</pre>

<div id="container2">&nbsp;</div>
<script>
var playerInstance = jwplayer("container2");
playerInstance.setup({
  playlist: "//content.jwplatform.com/feeds/13ShtP5m.rss",
  aspectratio: "16:9",
  skin:{
    name:"seven-2",
    url:"//s3.amazonaws.com/demo.jwplayer.com/visualplaylist/seven2.css"
    },
});
</script>
