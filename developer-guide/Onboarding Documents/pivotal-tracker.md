# Pivotal Tracker

Pivotal tracker is a project management tool we use. This tool allows the product managers to create a road map of the features we want to implement in the upcoming releases of the Mobile SDKs, and allows the engineers to see the tasks in the pipeline, as well as task descriptions and acceptance criterias.

A quick overview of Pivotal basics:
* There are 3 types of tasks on pivotal: Feature (something that our users need), Chore (an activity that does not provide any benefits for the users, but usually helps us, such as refactoring, investigations so on) and Bug (a tiny moth that sneaked into an old computer).
* Features should be estimated before we start working on them. we use Fibonacci numbers for story estimation (1, 2, 3, 5, 8 so on), where 1 stands for something that requires a 1 to several lines of code to be changed; 2 stands for something like one new method or small augmentation to an existing class; 3 is a whole new class or equal amount of modifications to existing code and so on. if a task is estimated as 13 usually itâ€™s a sign that the task is too big and should be divided into smaller tasks.
