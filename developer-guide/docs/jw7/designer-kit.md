#JW7 Designer Kit

The **JW7 Designer Kit** is a starting point for designing and building new skins. This photoshop template includes GUI elements found in the 7.9.1 release of JW7. The purpose of this kit is to encourage designers and developers to fully customize the player to create fully branded experiences for their content.

This PSD includes well organized and labeled layers that correspond to css selectors in our skinning model for easy collaboration between designers and developers. All elements and shapes within the PSD are fully editable.

You may also find our [CSS Skinning Model](//developer.jwplayer.com/jw-player/css-skinning-model.html) documentation useful as you get started designing your new skin.
