<div class="article_callout">This document applies to users of <strong>JW Player Ads</strong>. Don&#39;t have <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/products/jwplayer-ads/" target="_blank">Ads</a>? &nbsp;<a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/pricing/">Upgrade Now</a>.</div>

<p>In addition to standard, linear video advertising, JW Player also supports a method of displaying ad banners as an overlay on video content. This means that advertisements can appear in-line without disrupting playback. This method of advertising is known as a <strong>non-linear</strong> overlay.</p>

<p>Non-linear ads are configured via VAST in a similar way to linear ads. Within the creative portion, instead of specifying a linear ad type, a nonlinear type is used. A brief example of this configuration can be seen below:</p>

<pre>
&lt;Creative sequence=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
&lt;NonLinearAds&gt;
&lt;NonLinear height=&quot;50&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; maintainAspectRatio=&quot;true&quot; scalable=&quot;true&quot; minSuggestedDuration=&quot;00:00:30&quot;&gt;
&lt;StaticResource creativeType=&quot;image/jpeg&quot;&gt;
overlay.jpg
&lt;/StaticResource&gt;
&lt;NonLinearClickThrough&gt;http://www.jwplayer.com/&lt;/NonLinearClickThrough&gt;
&lt;/NonLinear&gt;
&lt;/NonLinearAds&gt;
&lt;/Creative&gt;</pre>

<p>Similar to linear ads in our <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1482127-static-vast-xml-tag" target="_blank">static VAST</a> article, JW Player looks for certain elements within a VAST tag creative to build an ad experience. In the above code, we can see the size of the advertisement, the picture file being loaded, where our clickthrough will direct to, and the length of time that this resource will appear for. Additionally, with the minSuggestedDuration portion, we also dictate how long this linear ad should appear for. (In this case, the overlay will show up for 30 seconds during content.)</p>

<p>The creative that we&#39;ve specified above is implemented in the player below. We&#39;ve also configured an offset of 5 seconds before displaying the ad. Using this offset configuration, nonlinear ad tags can be displayed at any time throughout a content file. Finally, we specify the ad <strong>type</strong> as a <strong>nonlinear</strong> ad. This allows the ad to play over content in an uninterrupted way. Also, ad markers will only appear for linear ads.</p>
