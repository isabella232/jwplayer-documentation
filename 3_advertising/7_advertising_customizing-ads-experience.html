<p>You can set an amount of time that you want your viewers to watch an ad before being allowed to skip it. When this skip offset is configured, a countdown will appear in the player and become active when the time has passed. This skip cancels the ad playback and does not fire any ad complete trackers.</p>

<h3>Please note that this option is configurable for VAST only and not Google IMA.</h3>

<p>If you are using a VAST 3.0 tag, any skipoffset specified in your ad tag will supercede any player-specific configuration options for skipping ads.<br />
<br />
<img alt="Skipping" src="//support-static.jwplayer.com/images/adskip.png" />​<br />
The following configuration options are available:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>skipoffset</strong></dt>
  <dd>Set this to an amount of time in seconds that you want an ad to be watched before it can be skipped.</dd>
  <dt><strong>skipmessage</strong></dt>
  <dd>This is used to provide a customized countdown message. Use the form <i>Skip ad in xx seconds.</i>.</dd>
  <dt><strong>skiptext</strong></dt>
  <dd>This sets the text of the Skip button after the countdown is over..</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Example Preroll with Skip</h2>

<p>To set a skip ad offset all you need to do is add the following to your advertising configuration block.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>skipoffset</dt>
  <dd>Set this to an amount of time in seconds that you want an ad to be watched before it can be skipped.</dd>
</dl>

<div id="container">&nbsp;</div>
<script>
var playerInstance = jwplayer("container");
playerInstance.setup({
  image: "//support-static.jwplayer.com/images/Skip_Ad.png",
  file: "//content.jwplatform.com/videos/bkaovAYt-640.mp4",
  advertising: {
    client: "vast",
   'skipoffset':5,
    tag: "//www.adotube.com/php/services/player/OMLService.php?avpid=oRYYzvQ&platform_version=vast20&ad_type=linear&groupbypass=1&HTTP_REFERER=http://www.longtailvideo.com&video_identifier=longtailvideo.com,test"
  }
});
</script>

<h3>Sample embed code</h3>

<p>The skipoffset can only be set at the advertising block level and not for individual ads in an ad schedule.</p>

<pre>
var playerInstance = jwplayer(&quot;myElement&quot;);
  playerInstance.setup({
    image: &quot;/uploads/myPoster.jpg&quot;,
    file: &quot;/uploads/myVideo.mp4&quot;,
    primary: &#39;flash&#39;,
    advertising: {
      client: &quot;vast&quot;,
     &#39;skipoffset&#39;:5,   
      tag: &quot;//adserver.com/vastResponse.xml&quot;
    }
  });

<!-- CONTENT BELOW FROM FORMER "Custom Ad Countdown" ARTICLE -->
<div class="article_callout">This document applies to users of <strong>JW Player Ads</strong>. Don&#39;t have <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/products/jwplayer-ads/" target="_blank">Ads</a>? &nbsp;<a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/pricing/">Upgrade Now</a>.</div>

<p>During playback of linear ads with VAST, JW Player displays a friendly ad message to notify viewers. However, via a simple customization option, it is possible to set a custom ad message. This article explains the process.</p>

<p>By default, JW Player&#39;s Ad message is &#39;This ad will end in xx seconds&#39;. However, because of langauge differences, desired branding, or if VAST tags are being configured for other means, this message is fully customizable. Our default message appears as follows:</p>
<img alt="JW7 Ad message mockup" src="http://support-static.jwplayer.com/images/admessage1.png" />
<p><br />
However, this message can be modified by setting the <strong>admessage</strong> configuration option inside of the <strong>advertising</strong> block. The string <strong>xx</strong> in this option will also automatically be replaced with a countdown. The use of the <strong>xx</strong> is entirely optional however. An example of a custom ad message configuration can be seen below:</p>

<div class="cont" id="container1">&nbsp;</div>
<script>
var playerInstance = jwplayer("container1");
playerInstance.setup({
  image: "//s1-www.ltvimg.com/cdn/farfuture/A4Ot5zIiiX6I0zhJTvqF9xyAg6frFcAuXu3YpmtQUzc/mtime:1388777784/sites/default/files/vast-preoll.png",
  file: "//content.jwplatform.com/videos/bkaovAYt-640.mp4",
width: '75%',
aspectratio: '16:9',
  advertising: {
    admessage: "This is totally not an ad that will end in xx seconds",
    client: "vast",
    tag: "//support-static.jwplayer.com/content/advertising/static-tag/preroll.new.xml"
  }
});
</script>

<pre>
var playerInstance = jwplayer(&#39;myElement&#39;);
playerInstance.setup({
file: &#39;assets/myVideo.mp4&#39;,
  advertising: {
  client: &#39;vast&#39;,
  tag: &#39;//adserver.com/vastResponse.xml&#39;,
  admessage: &#39;This is totally not an ad that will end in xx seconds.&#39;
}
});
</pre>

<!-- CONTENT BELOW FROM FORMER "Companion Ads" ARTICLE -->

<div class="article_callout">This document applies to users of <strong>JW Player Ads</strong>. Don&#39;t have <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/products/jwplayer-ads/" target="_blank">Ads</a>? &nbsp;<a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/pricing/">Upgrade Now</a>.</div>

<p>JW Player supports the insertion of companion ads into the page. HTML/IFRAME and GIF/JPG/PNG ads are supported for both VAST and IMA.</p>

<p>In order to render a companion, you must set the <strong>id</strong>, <strong>width</strong> and <strong>height</strong> of the DOM element the companion should be placed into. JW Player will then insert a companion if the ad tag contains one that <strong>exactly matches</strong> the <em>width</em> and <em>height</em> provided in the configuration. If the dimensions do not match up, JW Player will not display an ad. (which could lead to broken page designs)<br />
<br />
We can confirm our companion dimensions by viewing our VAST file itself. In the <strong>companion</strong> section, we can confirm:</p>

<pre>
&lt;Companion width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;250&quot;&gt;
</pre>

<p>This means that our tag will attempt to load a companion with a <em>width</em> of 300 and a <em>height</em> of 250. In addition, the div where we&#39;d like to set this up has been given the ID of <strong>rectangle</strong>. Within our <strong>advertising</strong> block, we will go ahead and set our <strong>companiondiv</strong> portion with the aforementioned information:</p>

<pre>
advertising: {
client: &quot;vast&quot;,
tag: &quot;myVast.xml&quot;
    companiondiv: {
        id: &quot;rectangle&quot;,
        width: 300,
        height: 250
        }
}
</pre>

<h3>​Example</h3>
<style type="text/css">#rectangle {   width: 300px; height: 250px;  background-color: #fff;
     margin-bottom:20px;
         box-shadow:0 0 4px #999;
      }
#container{ display: block; box-shadow:0 0 4px #999; margin: 20px 0 0 0; }
</style>
<p>Here&#39;s an example setup using a VAST tag that contains&nbsp;a banner companion ad. Using Google IMA companion ads would be set up in the same way, aside from using the <strong>googima</strong> client.</p>

<div id="banner" style="height:90px; width:728px; margin: 10px 0; background: #000;">&nbsp;</div>

<div id="container">&nbsp;</div>
<script>
var playerInstance = jwplayer("container");
playerInstance.setup({
  image: "//content.jwplatform.com/videos/3XnJSIm4-640.jpg",
  file: "//content.jwplatform.com/videos/3XnJSIm4-640.mp4",
   advertising: {
    client: "vast",
    tag: "//support-static.jwplayer.com/content/advertising/static-tag/preroll.new.xml",
    companiondiv: {
      id: "banner",
      width: 728,
      height: 90
    }
  },
  width: 728,
  height: 304
});
</script>

<p>Note that the companion will remain visible after the linear video ad has ended, until either another companion is loaded or the viewer navigates away from the page.</p>
