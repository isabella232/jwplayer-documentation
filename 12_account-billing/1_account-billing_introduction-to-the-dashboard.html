<p>In the <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/blog/new-publisher-dashboard/" target="_blank">new JW Player dashboard</a> you will notice a brand new design, and several new features including:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Deeper Analytics:</strong> Including device, domain &amp; country breakdowns.</li>
	<li><strong>External URLs:</strong> Manage, embed &amp; analyze self-hosted (live) streams. </li>
	<li><strong>Multiple Users:</strong> Manage access for more users in admin or editor roles.</li>
	<li><strong>Player Downloads:</strong> Get the self-hosting ZIPs, including our mobile SDKs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Moving to our new dashboard will not affect your content delivery, in-progress transcodes, API integrations or billing. Only the user interface will be updated (instantly and seamlessly). Watch the video demo of the dashboard (above) for a helpful walk-through. <br /></p>

<p><br />
<strong>Publish Mode</strong></p>

<p>On pages from which you can embed players or content, you will notice the Publish Mode widget at the top of the page. Each &ldquo;Embed&rdquo; link or button will open Publish Mode to create your single line embed code. Additionally, if you are embedding a single video, you can choose to include schema.org SEO tags which automatically pulls from your video metadata. You can also use Publish Mode to preview content using the preview page link.</p>
