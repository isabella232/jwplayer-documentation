KEYWORDS: playlists, playlist, visual playlist, embedding playlists, embed playlist, rss, manual playlist, dynamic playlist 


NOTES: 
When finished, this article should REPLACE the older "RSS Playlist Embed" article at this URL:
http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1406722 (content from that older article should be moved to "Basic Embed" with a new RSS feed section). 

Re-write to take out mentions of JW Platform; update screenshots for Unified. (Shannon can help with this).

NOTE: There is a Dashboard/Code tab code block (split between Dashboard and Code instructions) that needs to be implemented here. Ask Shannon for help when you get to this. 


-- CONTENT REPLACEMENT NOTE -- 
The below is a combination of three previous articles, "Creating Playlists (Platform)" and "Using Playlists (Embedding)", and "Using the Visual Playlist (Customization). Currently each article is separate and they are separated by HRs.

<h2>Playlists</h2>

<p>While there are certain ways to link to an external <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1406722-rss-playlist-embed">RSS</a> or XML file with playlist information, it is absolutely possible to configure a playlist directly into your JW Player embed. Let&#39;s jump into a few specific examples.</p>

<h2>Creating the player</h2>

<p>Understanding how a player functions with a single item is integral to understanding how to properly create a multi-item playlst. A single item is used here:</p>

<pre>
var playerInstance = jwplayer(&quot;player&quot;);
playerInstance.setup({
  file: &#39;myvideo.mp4&#39;,
  image: &#39;myposter.png&#39;,
  title: &#39;My Video&#39;,
  mediaid: &#39;123456&#39;
});
</pre>

<h2>A single item playlist</h2>

<p>Above, we&#39;ve configured only one single item within the player with a file, poster image, and title. However, let&#39;s say that we want to create a single-item playlist. In this case, rather than specifying a file, image, and title directly, we&#39;ll be inserting these into a &quot;playlist&quot; config block as a playlist item. Let&#39;s look at the above code in the context of a playlist:</p>

<pre>
playerInstance.setup({
playlist: [{
  file: &#39;myvideo.mp4&#39;,
  image: &#39;myposter.png&#39;,
  title: &#39;My Video&#39;,
  mediaid: &#39;123456&#39;
}]
});
</pre>

<p>Again, since we&#39;re listing this as a single playlist item, both of our code snippets will behave exactly the same way. However, using the playlist block allows us to easily insert additional playlist items if needed.<br />
For reference, the formatting for a playlist is as follows:</p>

<pre>
playlist: [{}, {}, ...]
</pre>

<h2>A two-item playlist</h2>

<p>So, with the above in mind, let&#39;s add a second video item&nbsp;to our playlist:</p>

<pre>
playerInstance.setup({
playlist: [{
  file: &#39;myvideo.mp4&#39;,
  image: &#39;myposter.png&#39;,
  title: &#39;My Video&#39;,
  mediaid: &#39;123456&#39;
},
{
  file: &#39;mysecondvideo.mp4&#39;,
  image: &#39;mysecondposter.png&#39;,
  title: &#39;My Second Video&#39;,
  mediaid: &#39;234567&#39;
}]
});
</pre>

<p>Awesome! We now have two items in our playlist.</p>

<h2>A three-item playlist... and beyond</h2>

<p>Any additional playlist items will follow the same convention as above. Each item (meaning a file, image, and title) will exist within {curly} brackets, separated by a comma, and all will be fully contained within a single set of [square brackets], similar to an array. Just for clarity, three playlist items would appear as:</p>

<pre>
playerInstance.setup({
playlist: [{
  file: &#39;myvideo.mp4&#39;,
  image: &#39;myposter.png&#39;,
  title: &#39;My Video&#39;,
  mediaid: &#39;123456&#39;
},
{
  file: &#39;mysecondvideo.mp4&#39;,
  image: &#39;mysecondposter.png&#39;,
  title: &#39;My Second Video&#39;,
  mediaid: &#39;234567&#39;
},
{
  file: &#39;mythirdvideo.mp4&#39;,
  image: &#39;mythirdposter.png&#39;,
  title: &#39;My Third Video&#39;,
  mediaid: &#39;345678&#39;
}]
});
</pre>

<p>Any configuration options after a playlist will still require a comma after the second square bracket similar to:</p>

<pre>
playerInstance.setup({
playlist: [{
  file: &#39;myvideo.mp4&#39;,
  image: &#39;myposter.png&#39;,
  title: &#39;My Video&#39;,
  mediaid: &#39;123456&#39;
},
{
  file: &#39;mysecondvideo.mp4&#39;,
  image: &#39;mysecondposter.png&#39;,
  title: &#39;My Second Video&#39;,
  mediaid: &#39;234567&#39;
},
{
  file: &#39;mythirdvideo.mp4&#39;,
  image: &#39;mythirdposter.png&#39;,
  title: &#39;My Third Video&#39;,
  mediaid: &#39;345678&#39;
}],
primary: &#39;flash&#39;
});
</pre>

<p>So again, this is still allowed, just keep the additional comma in mind when embedding!</p>

<h2>Sources with a playlist</h2>

<p>Lasty, it is entirely possible to create a playlist item that has multiple sources (Either using multiple qualities or fallbacks) in conjunction with our article <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1710454-configuring-multiple-sources">here</a>. You&#39;ll need to nest your sources block in place of&nbsp;&quot;file&quot;&nbsp;within the playlist item. So a quick example of the structure would look like:</p>

<pre>
playerInstance.setup({
    playlist: [{
        sources: [{source1},{source2},{source3}, ...],
        image: &#39;myposter.png&#39;,
        title: &#39;My Video&#39;,
        mediaid: &#39;123456&#39;
},{
        sources: [{source1},{source2},{source3}, ...],
        image: &#39;mysecondposter.png&#39;,
        title: &#39;My Second Video&#39;,
        mediaid: &#39;234567&#39;
},{
        sources: [{source1},{source2},{source3}, ...],
        image: &#39;mythirdposter.png&#39;,
        title: &#39;My Third Video&#39;,
        mediaid: &#39;345678&#39;
}],
});
</pre>

<p>An actual example of this would look like with 3 different sources per playlist item is shown here:</p>

<pre>
playerInstance.setup({
playlist: [{
     sources: [{ 
            file: &quot;myFile.flv&quot;
        },{ 
            file: &quot;myFile.mp4&quot;
        },{
            file: &quot;myFile.webm&quot;
        }],
     image: &#39;image.jpg&#39;,
     title: &#39;This is a multisource video!&#39;,
     mediaid: &#39;123456&#39;
},{
     sources: [{ 
            file: &quot;myFile2.flv&quot;
        },{ 
            file: &quot;myFile2.mp4&quot;
        },{
            file: &quot;myFile2.webm&quot;
        }],
     image: &#39;image2.jpg&#39;,
     title: &#39;This is another multisource video!&#39;,
     mediaid: &#39;234567&#39;
},{
     sources: [{ 
            file: &quot;myFile3.flv&quot;
        },{ 
            file: &quot;myFile3.mp4&quot;
        },{
            file: &quot;myFile3.webm&quot;
        }],
     image: &#39;image3.jpg&#39;,
     title: &#39;This the final multisource video!&#39;,
     mediaid: &#39;345678&#39;
}]
});
</pre>

<p>This article introduces the playlist management capabilities of <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/products/jwplatform/" target="_blank">JW Platform</a>. These can be found in the <em>Playlists</em> section of the dashboard:</p>

<p><img alt="playlists section overview page" src="/customer/portal/attachments/257236" /></p>

<div class="article_callout">This document applies to users of <strong>JW Platform</strong>. Don&#39;t have Hosting? <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/pricing/">Upgrade Now</a>.</div>

<h2>Creating Playlist</h2>

<p>Hit the big <em>Create New Playlist</em> button to popup the playlist overlay. In this, set a title for your playlist and the type op playlist you want to create:</p>

<p><img alt="playlists creation overlay" src="/customer/portal/attachments/257235" /></p>

<p>The two types of playlists behave differently, so make sure you understand their details:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Manual</strong> playlists are populated by hand. You literally drag &amp; drop videos into the playlist, just like you would with a tool like iTunes or Winamp. Manual playlists won&#39;t automatically get updated.</li>
	<li><strong>Dynamic</strong> playlists are automatically populated based upon rules. For example, you can create a playlist that has <em>All videos that are tagged with <strong>Cat</strong></em>. Every time you tag a new video with <strong>Cat</strong>, it will automatically get added to that playlist.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: make sure you have a couple of videos in your account already, otherwise there&#39;s no content to put inside your playlist.</p>

<h2>Managing Playlists</h2>

<p>Once a playlist is created, you can jump to the properties page of that playlist. Here is a screenshot of the properties of a <em>dynamic</em> playlist (<em>manual</em> playlist properties are very similar):</p>

<p><img alt="playlists properties page" src="/customer/portal/attachments/257237" /></p>

<p>On this page, you can manage all aspects of this playlist, including:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Updating the metadata of the playlist, like its <em>title</em> and <em>description</em>.</li>
	<li>For <strong>Dynamic</strong> playlists: Updating the rules for populating the playlist, like the tags to use, the sorting method and the maximum length.</li>
	<li>For <strong>Manual</strong> playlists: Searching and adding new videos by dragging them from the search results.</li>
	<li>Viewing the current lineup of the playlist. For <strong>Dynamic</strong> playlist, this is purely informational. For <strong>Manual</strong> playlists, you can also re-order or delete videos here.</li>
</ol>

<p>The right sidebar of the page contains the options for publishing the playlist to your audience.</p>

<h2>Publishing Playlists</h2>

<p>There are two ways to publish playlists from JW Platform. The most important and widely used one is by publishing it in JW Player. Do this by hitting the <em>Embed This Playlist</em> button. It will popup the publishing overlay:</p>

<p><img alt="playlists publishing overlay" src="/customer/portal/attachments/257238" /></p>

<p>Here, select which player design you want to use to publish your playlist. Next, copy/paste the resulting embed code into your own website or blog. A preview of your video+playlist is shown below the code.</p>

<p>Use the small links at the bottom to quickly publish the playlist to Facebook, to Twitter, or to Email in a preview page.</p>
<a name="rss"></a>

<h3>RSS Feed</h3>

<p>The other way to publish playlists is through RSS Feeds. This method is valuable for syndication of your video content to partners that have their own video player. The RSS feed contains all the metadata and media links they need to play your videos.</p>

<p>RSS Feeds are also useful for syndicating your content to podcasting services like iTunes. Our feeds are standard RSS and compliant with many of them.</p>
<a name="json"></a>

<h3>JSON Feed</h3>

<p>The latest addition to JW Platform allows for a user to receive a JSON feed of a particular video or playlist object. Compared to existing RSS feeds, JSON feeds allow for information related to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Available Transcodes</li>
	<li>Transcode labels</li>
	<li>Media dimensions</li>
	<li>Video type</li>
	<li>Content Duration</li>
	<li>Passthrough files</li>
	<li>Available Caption/Thumbnail Tracks</li>
</ul>

<p>With the above information, JW Platform&#39;s JSON feeds can be used to verify the completion/quantity of transcodes, as well as to populate meta information for social media sites like Facebook or Twitter. Previously, this information was only accessible via JW Platform&#39;s API, but it can now be pinged on a production site, which does not apply to JW Platform&#39;s 10 API calls/minute limit.</p>

<p>This article explains how to easily display the contents of your playlist with JW Player 7&#39;s integrated visual playlist feature.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>When using a playlist in any format(setup, xml, RSS) JW Player 7 will automatically include a visual playlist button on its control bar. Mousing over (or touching) this button will display a visual playlist, allowing a user to quickly jump between particular playlist items. Visual playlists are now rendered entirely over the player, without the need for additional vertical or horizontal space.</p>

<p>The visual playlist can be turned off by setting <strong>visualplaylist</strong> to false within the configuration setup. This is true by default.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The below is an example of the player&#39;s default handling of a visual playlist. The only thing specified in this case is an RSS playlist. The player will then populate the visual playlist automatically with the specified titles of each item.</p>

<div id="container">&nbsp;</div>
<script>
var playerInstance = jwplayer("container");
playerInstance.setup({
  playlist: "//content.jwplatform.com/feeds/13ShtP5m.rss",
  width: "70%",
  aspectratio: "16:9"
});
</script>

<h2>Embed code</h2>

<pre>
&lt;div id=&quot;myElement&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
var playerInstance = jwplayer(&quot;myElement&quot;);
    playerInstance.setup({
      playlist: &quot;/uploads/myPlaylist.rss&quot;
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<h2>Customizing the Visual Playlist with CSS</h2>

<p>The default style of the visual playlist has a maximum height. This is so it does not take up the entire height of the player. The visual playlist can be easily customized with CSS.</p>

<p>Here is some CSS you can add on your page or adjust directly in your self-hosted seven.css to make the visual playlist wider and as tall as the player.</p>

<pre>
/*Sets the visual listbar width to 400 px and realigns it above the icon. */
 .jw-skin-seven .jw-overlay .jw-playlist-container {
  width:400px;
  left:-20%;
 }

/* overrides the player settings for how tall the visualplaylist can be. 195px is the about right for a player that is 270px tall, including the controlbar height, and menus. */
.jwplayer .jw-playlist {
min-height: none;
max-height: none;
height: 195px;

 }

/* Makes it so the list items are left aligned in the visualplaylist */
 .jwplayer .jw-playlist .jw-option {
  padding: 0 15px;
  margin: auto;
  text-align: left;
}


</pre>

<div id="container2">&nbsp;</div>
<script>
var playerInstance = jwplayer("container2");
playerInstance.setup({
  playlist: "//content.jwplatform.com/feeds/13ShtP5m.rss",
  aspectratio: "16:9",
  skin:{
    name:"seven-2",
    url:"//s3.amazonaws.com/demo.jwplayer.com/visualplaylist/seven2.css"
    },
});
</script>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Creating Your Own Custom Sidebar</h2>

<p>If you are looking to do some additional customization work on a playlist sidebar, it is possible to create your own with our API and some CSS work. An example of this can be seen <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1543546-example-making-your-own-playlist-sidebar" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
