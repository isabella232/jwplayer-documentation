# Create an Android reproduction app

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/SDK-Android%20v3-0AAC29.svg?logo=android">

After reading our [documentation](https://developer.jwplayer.com/sdk/android/docs/developer-guide/), reviewing our [code samples](https://developer.jwplayer.com/android-sdk/demos/), and examining our demo, you may still be unable to resolve an implementation issue. At this point, you should replicate the issue using the JW Player SDK for Android Open Source Demo and submit a support ticket with a link to a zipped version of the entire Android Studio Project for review. 

Reproduction apps reduce the time necessary to resolve your issue in several ways:

- Clearly shows the implementation of your code
- Eliminates non-essential code and libraries
- Enables the Support Team to suggest code revisions

!!!
Be sure that your Android app is written in Java.
