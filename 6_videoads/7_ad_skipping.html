<div class="article_callout">This document applies to users of <strong>JW Player Ads</strong>. Don&#39;t have <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/products/jwplayer-ads/" target="_blank">Ads</a>? &nbsp;<a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/pricing/">Upgrade Now</a>.</div>

<p>You can set an amount of time that you want your viewers to watch an ad before being allowed to skip it. When this skip offset is configured, a countdown will appear in the player and become active when the time has passed. This skip cancels the ad playback and does not fire any ad complete trackers.</p>

<h3>Please note that this option is configurable for VAST only and not Google IMA.</h3>

<p>If you are using a VAST 3.0 tag, any skipoffset specified in your ad tag will supercede any player-specific configuration options for skipping ads.<br />
<br />
<img alt="Skipping" src="//support-static.jwplayer.com/images/adskip.png" />â€‹<br />
The following configuration options are available:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><strong>skipoffset</strong></dt>
  <dd>Set this to an amount of time in seconds that you want an ad to be watched before it can be skipped.</dd>
  <dt><strong>skipmessage</strong></dt>
  <dd>This is used to provide a customized countdown message. Use the form <i>Skip ad in xx seconds.</i>.</dd>
  <dt><strong>skiptext</strong></dt>
  <dd>This sets the text of the Skip button after the countdown is over..</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Example Preroll with Skip</h2>

<p>To set a skip ad offset all you need to do is add the following to your advertising configuration block.</p>

  <dd>Set this to an amount of time in seconds that you want an ad to be watched before it can be skipped.</dd>
</dl>

<div id="container">&nbsp;</div>
<script>
var playerInstance = jwplayer("container");
playerInstance.setup({
  image: "//support-static.jwplayer.com/images/Skip_Ad.png",
  file: "//content.jwplatform.com/videos/bkaovAYt-640.mp4",
  advertising: {
    client: "vast",
   'skipoffset':5,
    tag: "//www.adotube.com/php/services/player/OMLService.php?avpid=oRYYzvQ&platform_version=vast20&ad_type=linear&groupbypass=1&HTTP_REFERER=http://www.longtailvideo.com&video_identifier=longtailvideo.com,test"
  }
});
</script>

<h3>Sample embed code</h3>

<p>The skipoffset can only be set at the advertising block level and not for individual ads in an ad schedule.</p>

<pre>
var playerInstance = jwplayer(&quot;myElement&quot;);
  playerInstance.setup({
    image: &quot;/uploads/myPoster.jpg&quot;,
    file: &quot;/uploads/myVideo.mp4&quot;,
    primary: &#39;flash&#39;,
    advertising: {
      client: &quot;vast&quot;,
     &#39;skipoffset&#39;:5,   
      tag: &quot;//adserver.com/vastResponse.xml&quot;
    }
  });
</pre>
