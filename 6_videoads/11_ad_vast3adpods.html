<div class="article_callout">This document applies to users of <strong>JW Player Ads</strong>. Don&#39;t have <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/products/jwplayer-ads/" target="_blank">Ads</a>? &nbsp;<a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/pricing/">Upgrade Now</a>.</div>

<p>The <a href="http://www.iab.net/media/file/VASTv3.0.pdf">IAB VAST 3.0</a> template introduced the concept of Ad Pods. Ad Pods are a way to specify multiple &lt;ad&gt; elements which are to be sequenced together and played back-to-back in a singular ad break. Ad Pods are configured from VAST 3.0 compliant ad networks and passed to the JW Player. Additionally, it is possible to create custom, static ad pods either using in-line VAST data, or wrapped ad tags.</p>

<p>If a VAST 3.0 ad tag is configured to use Ad Pods, the JW Player will play the ads together anywhere the ad break was scheduled. Ad Pods can be scheduled as Pre-Rolls, Mid-Rolls, and even as Post-Rolls. The Advertising API has also been updated to contain the location of the ad in a pod and the total number of ads in a pod.</p>

<h2>Ad Pod Countdown Message</h2>

<p>By default, JW Player will use the following message prefixed to the ad countdown message: <strong>Ad <em>x</em> of <em>y</em></strong> (Where <em>x</em> is the current ad playing and <em>y</em> is the total number ads in the pod)</p>
<img alt="" src="//support-static.jwplayer.com/images/adpods1.png" />​
<p>The subsequent portion of the ad message is fully customizable. See the article about custom countdown messages <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1433868-custom-ad-countdown-message">here</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Pod API Calls</h2>

<p>Each <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1413089-javascript-api-reference#advertising">Advertising API</a> call also contains these two attributes if the ad is part of a pod:</p>

<dl>
    <dt><strong>sequence</strong></dt>
    <dd>This is the number of the ad in pod that is currently playing.</dd>
    <dt><strong>podcount</strong></dt>
    <dd>This is the total number of ads in the pod</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Sample Ad Pod</h2>

<p>A JW Player using a VAST3 ad pod is below:</p>

<div id="container">&nbsp;</div>
<script>
var playerInstance = jwplayer("container");
    playerInstance.setup({    
        image: "//s3.amazonaws.com/demo.jwplayer.com/advertising/assets/adpod.jpg",
        file: "//content.jwplatform.com/videos/s8BPzDe0-kNspJqnJ.mp4",
        advertising: {
            client:"vast",
            schedule:{
                adbreak1: {
                    offset:'pre',
                    tag: '//s3.amazonaws.com/demo.jwplayer.com/advertising/assets/vast3_jw_ads.xml'
                }
            }
        }
    });
</script>

<pre>
playerInstance = jwplayer(&quot;container&quot;);
playerInstance.setup({
     file: &quot;video.mp4&quot;,
     advertising: {
        client: &quot;vast&quot;,
            schedule:{
                adbreak1: {
                offset: &quot;pre&quot;,
                tag: &quot;adpod.xml&quot;
                }
            }
        }
});     
</pre>
