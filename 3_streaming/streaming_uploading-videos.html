<p>This article covers the content uploading and management capabilities of the JW Player dashboard, powered by JW Platform.</p> 
<p>We&#39;ll also cover different <strong>settings</strong> that can be applied to content hosted in JW Platform. All of these options can be accessed in the <a href="https://dashboard.jwplayer.com/#/content/list" target="_blank">Content</a> section of the JW Player dashboard, as well as via the <a href="http://developer.jwplayer.com/jw-platform/reference/v1/" target="_blank">JW Platform API</a>.</p>
<p>We cover more about hosting, storage, and streaming in <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1433634">another article</a>.</p>

<h2>Adding Content to Your Library</h2>
<h3>Adding External URLs</h3>
<p>JW Platform also accepts URLs from externally-hosted sources. These can be added into your library and used in the same way as uploaded content. External URLs do not count towards your monthly <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1433634#storage">storage limit</a>, though streams served from external URLs stored in our library do count towards your <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1433634#streaming">streaming</a> limit. </p>
<p>To add external URLs to your content library, select "Add via URL" from the dropdown next to the blue "Add content" button. 
</p>
<p><img alt="content list upload" src="//support-static.jwplayer.com/images/acct-billing/content-list-short.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Adding a URL does not ingest that video into our storage system. It is only a reference to the content that is hosted elsewhere. </p>
<h3>Uploading Content</h3>
<p>Start the upload process by clicking the big <em>Add Uploads</em> button at the left side of the <a href="https://dashboard.jwplayer.com/#/content/list" target="_blank">content list</a> page in the dashboard. Then, select your file (or multiple files) from the browser's filepicker.</p>
 <p><em><strong>Tip:</strong> Do not close your browser while video upload is in progress&mdash; that will cancel the upload!</em></p>

<p><strong>Formats supported</strong> by JW Platform include nearly any audio or video filetypes. This includes video in MP4, MOV, FLV, MPG, AVI and DV format, or audio in MP3, AAC, WAV, ASF, PCM, M4A or AIFF format. Notable exceptions include content that use the Apple Intermediate, Apple ProRes or GoToMeeting video codecs. We also do not support the uploading of content that is encrypted with DRM.</p>


<a name="metadata"></a>
<h2>Content Details &amp; Metadata</h2>
<p>Every video or external URL added to the JW Player Dashboard has its own details page:</p>

<p><img alt="content details page" src="//support-static.jwplayer.com/images/acct-billing/content-detail-tags.png" /></p>

<p>On this page, you can:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Edit video title and tags</strong>. Tags are used to segment your video library.</li>
  <li><strong>Set a preview thumbnail</strong>, either by uploading your own image or selecting a frame from the video.</li>
  <li><strong>Add metadata</strong> like description and <a href="#custom">custom parameters</a> (via the <em>Metadata</em> tab). </li>
	<li><strong>Upload text tracks</strong>, like captions or chapters (via the <em>Tracks</em> tab). These uploads should be in <!--<a href="#">-->WebVTT or SRT/DFXP format<!--</a>-->.</li>
    <li><strong>Upload a new version of the video</strong> and <strong>grab direct links</strong> to your video transcodes (via the <em>Sources</em> tab). The re-upload feature is great for when a video is already live, and you need to make a change. (Please note that it usually takes a while after uploading before these files are ready).</li>
	<li><strong>Grab embed codes</strong> to publish the video to your site.</li>
</ol>
<a name="custom"></a>

<h3>Custom Parameters</h3>

<p>Using custom metadata can be very useful when keeping track of, or displaying,  video information relevant to your business and workflows. For example, when loading episodes of a show, you can use this to track things like season number, episode number, featured actors, or production date. This information is then stored inside of a playlist object and can be utilized with JW Player&#39;s <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1413089-javascript-api-reference#playlist" target="_blank">Playlist API</a>.</p> <!-- This will also need a dev portal link-->

<p>Custom parameters can be accessed by clicking on the <strong>Metadata</strong> tab within a video object&#39;s detail page.</p>
<img src="//support-static.jwplayer.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/acct-billing/custom-parameters.png" alt="metadata tab of the content detail page" />
<p>The above variables will then be stored within a playlist as:</p>

<pre>&lt;jwplayer:keywords&gt;trailer, superhero, movie&lt;/jwplayer:keywords&gt;
&lt;jwplayer:VideoNumber&gt;0012&lt;/jwplayer:VideoNumber&gt;
</pre>

<p>In addition to media organization, such playlist information can also be used as values for targeted ads with our VAST client. This method requires the use of <strong>custom ad tag variables</strong>, which are mentioned <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1434340-ad-tag-variables#playlist" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>


<a name="sunrising"></a>

<h3>Content Sunrising</h3>

<p>Content sunrising is a feature that allows a publisher to choose a particular date and time that they would like to have a piece of media publicly available. This feature uses the &#39;publish date&#39; metadata field within a particular video object detail.</p>
<img alt="content sunrising" src="//support-static.jwplayer.com/images/acct-billing/content-sunrising.png"  />
<p>Due to different time zones, dates configured for media are centered around UTC. Specifying a time in UTC will localize publish time based on the utilized computer&#39;s own timezone settings and show this updated information below.</p>

<p>If a future publish date is specified, this means:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Content (transcoded files, poster images, sources, etc.) will not be accessible publicly</li>
	<li>Content will not appear in playlists, either dynamically or statically</li>
	<li>Media will continue to be privately accessible/modifiable via the Dashboard and <a href="http://developer.jwplayer.com/jw-platform/" target="_blank">API</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Once a publish date/time is reached, media will be accessible by public viewers.</p>

<a name="publishing"></a>

<h2>Publishing Videos</h2>

<p>Clicking the <em>Embed</em> button (from the content detail or content list pages) will open the <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2160275#publish-mode">Publish Mode</a> tool at the top of the page.</p>

<p><img alt="content detail page publish" src="//support-static.jwplayer.cpm/images/acct-billing/content-detail-embed.png" /></p>
<p>Copy/paste the resulting single-line embed code into your own website or blog.</p>
<p>A preview of your video + player is shown at the right of publish mode, and you can use the small "preview page" link at the bottom to quickly view your embed in a separate page.</p>

<!--
<p>Use the small links at the bottom to quickly publish the video to Facebook, to Twitter, or to Email in a preview page.</p> -->
