<p>It is very important to make sure your live stream is the highest possible quality. Make sure you choose your video/audio settings from our recommended settings below, which will result in a reliable stream based on your Internet connection.</p>

<p>It is important to test your workflow before going live. We recommend conducting a full workflow test from beginning to end. Tests should include the actual camera(s), and other hardware/software you'll be using in your production workflow. Also, the test should be conducted for the entire length of your expected broadcast length to ensure reliability.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: Please also make sure that you test your internet connection prior to broadcasting to ensure adequate throughput. It is recommended to have at least 3x the bitrate of uplink bandwidth for a stable connection.</strong></p>
