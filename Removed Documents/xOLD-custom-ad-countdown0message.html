<p>During playback of linear ads, JW Player displays a friendly ad message to notify viewers. However, via a simple customization option, it is possible to set a custom ad message. This article explains the process.</p>

<p>By default, JW Player&#39;s Ad message is &#39;This ad will end in xx seconds&#39;. However, because of langauge differences, desired branding, or if advertising is being configured for other means, this message is fully customizable. Our default message appears as follows:</p>
<img alt="JW7 Ad message mockup" src="http://support-static.jwplayer.com/images/admessage1.png" />
<p><br />
However, this message can be modified by setting the <strong>admessage</strong> configuration option inside of the <strong>advertising</strong> block. The string <strong>xx</strong> in this option will also automatically be replaced with a countdown. The use of the <strong>xx</strong> is entirely optional however. An example of a custom ad message configuration can be seen below:</p>

<div class="cont" id="container1">&nbsp;</div>
<script>
var playerInstance = jwplayer("container1");
playerInstance.setup({
  image: "//s1-www.ltvimg.com/cdn/farfuture/A4Ot5zIiiX6I0zhJTvqF9xyAg6frFcAuXu3YpmtQUzc/mtime:1388777784/sites/default/files/vast-preoll.png",
  file: "//content.jwplatform.com/videos/bkaovAYt-640.mp4",
width: '75%',
aspectratio: '16:9',
  advertising: {
  	admessage: "This is totally not an ad that will end in xx seconds",
    client: "vast",
    tag: "//support-static.jwplayer.com/content/advertising/static-tag/preroll.new.xml"
  }
});
</script>

<pre>
var playerInstance = jwplayer(&#39;myElement&#39;);
playerInstance.setup({
file: &#39;assets/myVideo.mp4&#39;,
	advertising: {
	client: &#39;vast&#39;,
	tag: &#39;//adserver.com/vastResponse.xml&#39;,
	admessage: &#39;Our message will end in xx seconds.&#39;
}
});
</pre>

<p>Note that as of JW Player 7.3, the Google IMA plugin will utilize JW Player&#39;s own skinning model and any configured custom messages.</p>
