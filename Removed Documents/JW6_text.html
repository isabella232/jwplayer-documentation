<body>
<p>There are instances when the JW Player&#39;s default text may need to be altered. A good case for this would be if you need to localize&nbsp;JW Player for&nbsp;a non-English speaking market. A reference of all customizable text is below.</p>

<h2>General Playback</h2>
<img alt="" src="/customer/portal/attachments/344336" style="width: 663px; height: 287px;" />
<ol>
	<li><strong>title </strong>or<strong> displaytitle:</strong> Either can change the title attached to the play button, however displaytitle will override any titles set in a playlist. This will also affect the text appearing in the control bar during a live stream.</li>
	<li><strong>abouttext:</strong> Customizes the right click text.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Advertising</h2>

<p>When using our VAST client, there are three items that are able to be customized. Each of these options would be configured in your <strong>advertising</strong> block. Please note that all of these customization options are not available when using our Google IMA client. Currently only <strong>admessage</strong> is supported.</p>

<img alt="" src="/customer/portal/attachments/417004" style="width: 136px; height: 84px;" /><br />
&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li><strong>admessage</strong>: The message that will display as an ad plays. See <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1433868">here</a> for more information.</li>
	<li><strong>skipmessage</strong>: The text that displays before an ad can be skipped</li>
	<li><strong>skiptext</strong>: The text that appears after an ad can be skipped</li>
	<li><strong>cuetext</strong>: The text that shows up when an advertising cuepoint is moused over.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Sharing and Related Tooltips</h2>

<p>Text used within our Sharing and Related features is not directly editable, however the tooltips that appear when a mouse hovers above the buttons can be customized with the <strong>heading</strong> option. Each is configured within the appropriate <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1409745-display-related-videos"><strong>related</strong></a> or <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1409823-social-sharing-overlay"><strong>sharing</strong></a> block. Default text for each can be seen below.</p>
<img alt="" src="/customer/portal/attachments/344355" style="width: 109px; height: 91px;" /><br />
