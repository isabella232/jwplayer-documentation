<h2>Do I need to purchase a license?</h2>

<p>Below is a list of the most common reasons you will need to purchase a JW Player license:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You are interested in one or more of the features offered in our <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/pricing/">licensed player editions</a>.</li>
	<li>You exceed, or expect to exceed, our monthly video play quota.</li>
	<li>You would like to run ads in your JW Player to monetize your video content.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How do I purchase a license?</h2>

<p>To purchase JW Player, visit our <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/pricing/">Pricing Page</a> to view our different editions and offerings. If you&#39;re choosing the Premium edition, you can order immediately. Enterprise and hosting upgrades are handled via our <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/contact-us/">Contact Us</a> page. <strong>Note:</strong> If you have an existing Free account with us, make sure that you are using the same email address when upgrading.</p>
<a name="ads"></a>

<h2>If I wish to run ads via a third party plugin, do I still need an Ads license?</h2>

<p>To run video ads in any form, you <strong>must</strong> be properly licensed with an Ad version.</p>
<a name="upgrade"></a>

<h2>I&#39;ve just upgraded my license. Why is my player not reflecting this change?</h2>

<p>After upgrading your license, the key found on your <a href="https://account.jwplayer.com/#/account" target="_blank">account page</a> will change to reflect this. As a result, you will need to manually update your self-hosted key on your website. If a cloud-hosted library was utilized, this change will happen automatically.</p>
<a name="domains"></a>

<h2>How many domains can be used with a single JW7 license?</h2>

<p>As with JW6, Free users can use their player on <strong>one domain</strong>, when JW Player Premium can be used on up to 10 domains. For more domains, you will need to utilize an <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/contact-us/">Enterprise License</a>.</p>
<a name="methods"></a>

<h2>What payment methods do you accept?</h2>

<p>When purchasing online, we accept only credit card and PayPal.</p>
<a name="billing"></a>

<h2>Where can I change my payment information?</h2>

<p>Billing information can be changed on your <a href="https://account.jwplayer.com/#/account/billing" target="_blank">billing page</a>. We will reference this updated information on your next billing cycle.</p>
<a name="custom"></a>

<h2>I am interested in an Enterprise or Ads license. Also, video hosting! How do I purchase any of these?</h2>

<p>Enterprise/Ads licenses, as well as hosting upgrades, are handled via our <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/contact-us/">Contact Us</a> page. A sales team member will be in contact shortly after submitting.</p>
<a name="reseller"></a>

<h2>I am interested in reselling JW Player, how do I find more information?</h2>

<p>If you are interested in becoming a reseller for JW Player, please <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/contact-us/enterprise/">Contact Us</a> directly.</p>
<a name="transfer"></a>

<h2>Can I transfer my license to someone else?</h2>

<p>JW Player licenses are non-transferrable.</p>
<a name="refund"></a>

<h2>What is your refund policy?</h2>

<p>All fees are non-refundable except if otherwise provided in the <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/tos/" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a>.</p>

<h2>I seem to be getting an error while trying to pay with my American Express credit card.</h2>

<p>American Express cards are unique and require a 4 digit security code located on the <strong>front</strong> of your credit card. Make sure you use this code, instead of a 3 digit code.</p>
