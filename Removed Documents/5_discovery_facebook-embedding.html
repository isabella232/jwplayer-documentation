<p>JW Player supports embedding on Facebook with a separate &quot;Facebook-specific&quot; player. Before implementing this feature, please note that this lightweight player does not support the following:</p>

<p>If you are using JW Platform, these OG Tags will be generated automatically based on your internal platform metadata. (Your configured title within platform will generate the appropriate &quot;title&quot; OG tag, for instance) If you would prefer a more manual setup however, a step-by-step process is listed below.</p>

<h2>Step 1 &mdash; Setting up your Facebook Player</h2>

<p>Acquiring your Facebook player can be done by contacting JW Player support and requesting this. Note that this player is only available for currently subscribed JW Premium users and higher.</p>

<p>The JW Player for Facebook operates in a slightly different method than the standard JW Player 6. Here, we are capable of loading a setup configuration within a single URL, rather than utilizing javascript exclusively. The only required configuration option here is the file option. If we were to load a video file within the context of our player SWF, you would need two URLs. One would be the player.swf, and the other would be the video file itself. If our SWF file were located at the following URL:</p>

<pre>
http://mysite.com/jwplayer/player.swf</pre>

<p>And we wished to load a video file located here:</p>

<pre>
http://mysite.com/myvideo.mp4</pre>

<p>We would first need to encode the MP4 URL.</p>

<pre>
http%3A//mysite.com/myvideo.mp4</pre>

<p>After doing this and combining the two portions, our resultant URL would appear as:</p>

<pre>
http://mysite.com/jwplayer/player.swf?file=http%3A//mysite.com/myvideo.mp4</pre>

<p>If we were to test and access this URL directly, you should see only my player and its content.<br />
As a final step, we&#39;ll add our autostart=true config option to allow automatic playback in a Facebook news feed. This is not a required configuration option, but it is a recommended one.</p>

<pre>
http://mysite.com/jwplayer/player.swf?file=http%3A//mysite.com/myvideo.mp4&amp;autostart=true</pre>

<p>If you&#39;re able to access your content and your player by accessing your version of the above URL, good job! On to step 2.</p>

<h2>Step 2 &mdash; Configuring your OG Tags</h2>

<p>OG (Open Graph) Meta Tags are the method of choice for relaying information to Facebook when content is shared. It&#39;s worth noting that this meta info is to be specified in the HTML that your player exists on. As such, the player is not responsible for things like Title, Description, or Thumbnails. Again, this is all dictated based on your OG tags on the web page itself. To understand how OG tags work, we highly recommend reading Facebook&#39;s page <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/webmasters#markup">here</a>.</p>

<p>By sharing a page with an embedded video, you&#39;ll likely want to to share the video itself on Facebook, and allow in-line playback on someone&#39;s news feed or wall.<br />
We suggest using the following OG tags if possible:</p>

<pre>
&lt;meta property=&quot;og:url&quot; content=&quot;http://mysite.com/sharingiscaring.html&quot;&gt;</pre>

<p>The actual URL that will be shared on Facebook when someone shares your web page.</p>

<pre>
&lt;meta property=&quot;og:title&quot; content=&quot;Sharing on Facebook with JW Player!&quot;&gt;</pre>

<p>The title that will appear on a Facebook story when it gets shared.</p>

<pre>
&lt;meta property=&quot;og:image&quot; content=&quot;http://mysite.com/myposterimage.jpg&quot;&gt;</pre>

<p>Your poster image for the player itself.</p>

<pre>
&lt;meta property=&quot;og:type&quot; content=&quot;video&quot;&gt;</pre>

<p>The type of content that you&#39;re looking to share when sharing a page.</p>

<pre>
&lt;meta property=&quot;og:video&quot; content=&quot;http://mysite.com/jwplayer/player.swf?config=http%3A//mysite.com/myvideo.mp4&amp;autostart=true&quot;&gt;</pre>

<p>The actual video content that will be shared as per Step 1. However, you will also need to configure a secure_url tag in addition to a video tag.</p>

<pre>
&lt;meta property=&quot;og:video:secure_url&quot; content=&quot;https://mysite.com/jwplayer/player.swf?file=https%3A//mysite.com/myvideo.mp4&amp;autostart=true&quot;&gt;</pre>

<p>This is a newer requirement by Facebook. Content and components must be loaded via HTTPS in order to appear in-line on news feeds. Therefore, your config file and player.swf should be served via HTTPS.</p>

<pre>
&lt;meta property=&quot;og:video:type&quot; content=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot;&gt;</pre>

<p>Here, we specify the method of content loading. Since we&#39;re using a Flash-based SWF to load and play video content, this should be set to: application/x-shockwave-flash</p>

<pre>
&lt;meta property=&quot;og:description&quot; content=&quot;Want to know how to embed on Facebook? Here&#39;s the answer!&quot; &gt;</pre>

<p>The description of the shared content. This will appear below your configured title.</p>

<pre>
&lt;meta property=&quot;og:video:width&quot; content=&quot;480&quot;&gt;</pre>

<pre>
&lt;meta property=&quot;og:video:height&quot; content=&quot;360&quot;&gt;</pre>

<p>The size that your video content will appear.</p>

<p>Once all of the above are configured, and you share a web page, Facebook will pull information from these tags and use it to populate your share. If we&#39;re using the example OG tags from above, sharing the web page should appear as the following:</p>
<img src="//support-static.jwplayer.com/images/facebooksharing.png" />
<h2>Step 3 &mdash; Configuring your &quot;sharing&quot; block</h2>

<p>The next step involves the configuration of your JW Player&#39;s sharing block. By default, when a share action is performed, the page where the player is embedded will be the page that is shared. For any additional configuration options, please see our configuration page <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1413113-configuration-options-reference#sharing">here</a>.</p>
