# Troubleshoot analytics discrepancies

<sup>_Last Updated: December 5, 2018_</sup>

When comparing metrics from multiple sources, discrepancies of less than 15% can be expected. Discrepancies can occur due to ad blockers that can prevent analytics tracking or different methods used to calculate metrics. 

## Troubleshoot a discrepancy

If you experience a discrepancy that is greater than 15%, follow these steps:

1. Confirm that your third-party analytics solution has been accurately configured with the player [events you want to track](track-video-metrics).
2. If you continue to see a discrepancy, submit a support ticket. Be sure to include answers to the questions in the _Submit a support ticket_ section below.

## Submit a support ticket

When submitting an analytics discrepancy [support ticket](https://support.jwplayer.com/submit-support-case), please provide the following:

1. <strong>Answers to the following questions</strong>:<br/>- With which metrics do discrepancies greater than 15% occur?<br/>- Expressed as a percentage, how large is the discrepancy?<br/>- Which third-party analytics solutions do you use?<br/>- For which events are you listening?<br/>- When did the discrepancy begin?<br/>- Is the discrepancy still appearing in your reports?<br/>- Have any recent code changes been made to your properties?<br/>- Have any recent changes been made to your player configuration, settings, or playlists?
2. <strong>Raw data from your third-party analytics solution.</strong> The data should cover a data range from a few weeks leading up to the discrepancy to then a few weeks after. The data should be broken out by date, geography, page URL, domain, browser, and device.
