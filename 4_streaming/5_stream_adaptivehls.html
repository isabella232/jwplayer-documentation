<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>If the M3U8 manifest provided contains so-called <em>variant playlists</em>, the JW Player automatically starts playing the highest quality stream that fits the bandwidth and the screen size. JW Player automatically adjusts the stream if the bandwidth increases or decreases during playback.</p>

<p>At the same time, users are able to select their quality of choice through a <em>Quality</em> menu in the controlbar. In addition to the preselected <em>Auto</em> option, all variant streams are available. If a user chooses a distinct stream, the automated quality switching is disabled:</p>

<p>The labels for these options are automatically generated from the M3U8 file, using either the <em>NAME</em> (first choice), <em>RESOLUTION</em> (second choice) or <em>BANDWIDTH</em> (fallback) attribute. Here is an M3U8 manifest that provides all these attributes:</p>

<pre>
#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:PROGRAM-ID=1,BANDWIDTH=1600000,RESOLUTION=1280x720,NAME=&quot;720p HD&quot;
1280/prog_index.m3u8
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:PROGRAM-ID=1,BANDWIDTH=832000,RESOLUTION=640x360,NAME=&quot;360p SD&quot;
640/prog_index.m3u8
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:PROGRAM-ID=1,BANDWIDTH=320000,RESOLUTION=320x180,NAME=&quot;180p 3G&quot;
320/prog_index.m3u8
</pre>

<p>The Wowza Media Server supports rendering of these variant playlists out of the box. See their <a href="http://www.wowza.com/forums/content.php?35#ABR" target="_blank"> Adaptive Bitrate Streaming</a> tutorial for details on how to set this up.</p>

<p>Note that JW Player also uses <em>RESOLUTION</em> to determine the aspect ratio of a stream. If it is not set, JW Player presumes a default aspect ratio of 16:9.</p>

<h2>Example HLS Adaptive Stream</h2>

<p>Here is an example of a basic setup of JW Player, presenting an HTTP Live Streaming Adaptive Stream:</p>

<h3>Sample Embed code</h3>

<p>As always, ensure you have uploaded a copy of JW Player and included the script in the &lt;head&gt; of your page, together with your player key. See the <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1406723-basic-video-embed" target="_blank">Basic Video Embed</a> reference for more info. Next, place the following embed code at the location you want the player to appear:</p>

<pre>
&lt;div id=&quot;myElement&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
var playerInstance = jwplayer(&quot;myElement&quot;);
playerInstance.setup({
	image: &quot;/uploads/myPoster.jpg&quot;,
	file: &quot;/uploads/myManifest.m3u8&quot;,
});
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>Note that both the M3U8 manifests and the TS fragments of an HLS stream are subject to cross-domain security restrictions and therefore won&#39;t automatically load from another domain than the player. See <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1403679-crossdomain-file-loading" target="_blank">Crossdomain File Loading</a> for more info.</p>
