<h2>Embedding a Stream</h2>

<p>Embedding an HLS stream using JW Player is a matter of providing the location to the stream&#39;s <strong>M3U8</strong> manifest file. This is essentially the same as using an MP4 as mentioned on our&nbsp;<a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1406723-mp4-video-embed" target="_blank">embedding topic</a>, however we&#39;ll instead be pointing to an M3U8:</p>

<pre>
var playerInstance = jwplayer(&quot;myElement&quot;);
playerInstance.setup({
    file: &quot;/assets/myVideoStream.m3u8&quot;,
    image: &quot;/assets/myPoster.jpg&quot;
});
</pre>

<p>We&#39;re pleased to announce the return of the JW Jellyfish!</p>
<style type="text/css">#container{ display: block; margin-left: 10px; box-shadow:0 0 4px #999; }
</style>
<div id="container">&nbsp;</div>
<script type="text/javascript">
var playerInstance = jwplayer("container");
playerInstance.setup({
androidhls: true,
file: "//wowza.jwplayer.com:1935/live/jelly.stream/playlist.m3u8",
image: "//assets-jpcust.jwpsrv.com/thumbs/pUfDwTqw-720.jpg",
            title:"Jellyfishes' Return",
            width: 720,
            height: 400,
primary: 'flash'
        });
</script>

<p>During their travels, the JW Jellyfish have had some intense spiritual rediscoveries. As a result, they claim to have been reborn as new Jellies and may not be recognizeable as their former selves. (Not in a literal sense, of course)</p>

<h2>Using HLS with a Video File Backup</h2>

<p>Our HLS provider requires Flash to function on all desktop browsers other than Safari for OSX. If you are using an HLS stream for on-demand content, it is possible to set up a fallback video file that will work properly in supported browsers in HTML5. The use of fallbacks can be seen here:</p>

<pre>
var playerInstance = jwplayer(&quot;myElement&quot;);
playerInstance.setup({
    playlist: [{
        image: &quot;/assets/myPoster.jpg&quot;,
        sources: [{ 
            file: &quot;/assets/myStream.m3u8&quot;
        },{
            file: &quot;/assets/myVideo.mp4&quot;
        }]
    }],
    primary: &quot;flash&quot;
});
</pre>

<p>With the sources configured within a <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1413113-configuration-options-reference#playlist" target="_blank">playlist block</a>, we also have the <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1413113-configuration-options-reference#basic" target="_blank">primary</a> option&nbsp;set to <strong>flash</strong>.</p>

<h3>Customizing Quality Labels</h3>

<p>Sometimes it is necessary to adjust the quality labels inside the HD menu. You can do this with hlslabels configuration option.</p>

<dl>
    <dt><strong>hlslabels</strong></dt>
    <dd>By default, the JW Player will set video quality levels using information from the manifest files. Use this configuration option to apply a custom quality label to a desired bandwidth in kbps. For example:</dd>
</dl>

<pre>
    hlslabels:{
           &quot;2500&quot;:&quot;High&quot;,
           &quot;1000&quot;:&quot;Medium&quot;
    }
</pre>

<h3>Using HLS on Android</h3>

<p>HLS playback quality and performance varies widely across Android versions and devices. For this reason, by default JW Player disables HLS playback on Android devices. For Android devices running 4.1 and higher, you can enable HLS streams to be played with the following configuration option.</p>

<dl>
    <dt>androidhls</dt>
    <dd>Set this value to <strong>true</strong> if you would like the JW Player to play HLS video sources on Android devices 4.1 and greater. As of JW 7.0.1, the default value for this flag is <strong>true</strong>.</dd>
</dl>
