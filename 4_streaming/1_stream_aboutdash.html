<p>MPEG-DASH (Short for &ldquo;Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) is an HTML5-based streaming standard that is supported by JW Player 7 Premium licenses and higher.<sup>1</sup> More information on this standard and its functionality is available <a href="http://dashif.org/">here</a>.</p>

<p><span style="font-size:9px;"><sup>1</sup>DRM only available in Enterprise or Ads licenses.</span></p>

<p>Similar to other streaming technologies like HLS, DASH relies on manifest files. Rather than using M3U8 files, DASH uses XML-based MPD manifests. These MPD files then direct the DASH provider to the different pieces of a particular media stream, which are then selectively chosen and played. This selection is based on criteria such as available user bandwidth.</p>

<p>These MPD files also allow for great flexibility in regards to independent quality of video and audio. Bandwidth and quality information is also stored within MPD manifests to assist with adaptive selection by the DASH provider.</p>

<p>It is worth also noting that MPEG DASH is codec-agnostic, and will therefore work with files encoded in h.264/AAC or vp8/vorbis. The ability to play these streams in HTML5 therefore rests in the browser itself. This document will be referring to DASH 264, as it is more widespread across desktop and mobile.

<h2>Features currently supported with JW Player 7 DASH:</h2>

  <li><strong>DRM - </strong>As of JW Player&#39;s 7.0 release, <a href="https://www.widevine.com/wv_drm.html">Widevine</a> is the only supported method of DRM.
