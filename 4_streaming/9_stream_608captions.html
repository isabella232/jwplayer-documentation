<p>The JW Player will detect and display CEA-608 captions that were injected into H264 SEI messages of an HTTP Live Streams. These captions can be turned on or off with the normal closed captions toggle. The detection of CEA-608 captions is available in the <strong>Premium</strong> edition of the JW Player.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>All that is needed to display these captions is to set the file of a player embed to an m3u8 stream that has the captions injected into the H264 SEI messages. The player will handle the rest.</p>

<pre>
var playerInstance = jwplayer(&quot;myVideo&quot;);
playerInstance.setup({
    file: &quot;myCaptionStream.m3u8&quot;
});

</pre>

<div id="container">&nbsp;</div>
<script type="text/javascript">
var playerInstance = jwplayer("container");
playerInstance.setup({
file: "//playertest.longtailvideo.com/adaptive/captions/playlist.m3u8",
