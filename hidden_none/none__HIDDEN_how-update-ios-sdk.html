<p>In order to take full advantage of our iOS SDK improvements, you should update your JW Player framework within Xcode using the following instructions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Overwrite the existing &ldquo;JWPlayer-iOS-SDK.framework&rdquo; file linked in your project with the new framework version.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Build and run your project.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
