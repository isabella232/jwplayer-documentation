<p>In order to take full advantage of our SDK improvements, you should update your current Android development environment using the following instructions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Sign in to your <a href="https://account.jwplayer.com/">JW Player Dashboard</a> and download the latest SDK version from your Account tab. </p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In Android Studio, remove the module dependency for jwplayer-android-x.y.z for your app, then remove the jwplayer module itself.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Import the new .AAR file contained in the newest version Zip package downloaded from your Account tab in the JW Player Dashboard. Finally, add the new jwplayer-android-x.y.x module as a module dependency for your app.<br />
	&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are using Maven: </p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>If the dependency version is a + (e.g. compile &#39;com.longtailvideo.jwplayer:jwplayer-android-sdk:+&#39;) in build.gradle the SDK will update automatically when each build is done.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If there is a locked-in version (e.g. compile &#39;com.longtailvideo.jwplayer:jwplayer-android-sdk:1.1.99&#39;) you must change it to the latest version number or a plus sign.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
