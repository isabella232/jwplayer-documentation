Introduction<br />
The JW Player Android SDK is a media player for Android that supports Apple HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) and MP4 playback. The SDK has video specific methods / classes to aid developers in creating custom video applications for Android mobile devices.<br />
<br />
The SDK package includes a demo application (JWPlayerDemo.apk) to demonstrate functionality to non-developers, as well as source code for a simple sample application to help get you started.&nbsp;<br />
Intended Audience<br />
This guide assumes that you have the necessary Java and Android development skills to work successfully with the JW Player for Android. You should know how to build and compile Android applications using Eclipse and the latest tools from the Android Developers Kit.<br />
Functional Support Overview<br />
HLS Features<br />
JW Player for Android supports the following features:<br />
<br />
Automatic adaptive HLS playback on Android 4.0 and later<br />
Playback of live HLS streams<br />
Playback of AES encrypted HLS streams<br />
Fallback mechanism to an HLS provider within the SDK for Android versions prior to 4.x. This provider enables playback of single HLS streams from a master playlist, as well as manual switching among variants using the Quality API.<br />
This API can also be used on Android 4.x.&nbsp;<br />
Labeling streams in the Player to enable manual user quality switching<br />
MPEG Transport Stream (.ts) with H.264 Baseline/Main/High profile video and/or AAC/MP3 audio, or elementary AAC/MP3 audio.<br />
H.264 B-frame support<br />
Additional Features<br />
In addition to HLS and MP4 playback, the JW Player for Android supports the following video playback functionality:<br />
<br />
Attribute to provide a poster image in the player (local image file or URL)<br />
Fullscreen video playback<br />
API to monitor player state, buffering, seeking, errors, etc.<br />
API to monitor and set video qualities<br />
VAST advertising<br />
Player user interface customization using 9-patch PNG images. Show or hide media player control bar<br />
Getting Started<br />
The SDK can be added to your Android project from the local file system.&nbsp;<br />
Using the SDK with Android Studio<br />
In order to use JW Player SDK you need to use the latest Android Studio:<br />
http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html<br />
The SDK .aar can be added to your Android project either as a remote dependency using maven, or from the local file system.<br />
<br />
Build Steps using AAR from your local file system<br />
You can download the AAR file in a Zip package from your JW Player dashboard. The download link is located in your dashboard under Account Settings or Account Advanced.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Log in to your JW Player dashboard at https://account.jwplayer.com.<br />
Browse to your Account Settings or Account Advanced tab.<br />
In the Downloads section, click the Android SDK download link.<br />
Unzip the Android SDK package to your local hard drive.<br />
In Android Studio go to File &gt; New Module&hellip; &gt; More Modules &gt; Import .JAR or .AAR Package.<br />
Navigate to the location where you unzipped the AAR file, select it, then click Finish.<br />
Go to File &gt; Project Structure&hellip;<br />
Make sure your app is selected in the left-hand pane, then click the Dependencies tab.<br />
Click the green plus sign in the upper righthand corner of the dialog and choose Module Dependency.<br />
Select the jwplayer-android-sdk module and click OK.<br />
Click OK again to close the dialog, the JW Player SDK should now be available in your project.<br />
Classes and Methods<br />
JWPlayerView&nbsp;<br />
The JWPlayerView is the main View for the Player. It is accessible through the &quot;Custom &amp; Library Views&quot; tab in the Graphical Layout editor in Android Studio.<br />
<br />
It has several optional properties:<br />
<br />
jwp:controls<br />
Turn controls on (default) or off<br />
jwp:file<br />
Set the default URL to load<br />
jwp:posterURL<br />
Set the image URL to display as preview<br />
jwp:posterDrawable &nbsp;<br />
Set the image internal drawable to display as preview<br />
jwp:controlsFullscreen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Turn fullscreen control on (Default) or off<br />
jwp:controlsQuality<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Turn quality control on (Default) or off<br />
jwp:controlsTimePlayed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Turn the time played text visible (Default) or off<br />
jwp:controlsTotalDuration<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Turn duration text visible (Default) or off<br />
jwp:controlsSeekEnabled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Turns the seekBar enabled (Default) or disabled<br />
jwp:replayButtonEnabled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Turn the replay control enabled (Default) or disabled after a media has completed<br />
<br />
If a poster image URL and internal drawable are provided, the URL will show by default and the drawable if there is an error downloading the image.<br />
<br />
After adding the JWPlayerView to your layout your layout should have an entry similar to this:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;com.longtailvideo.jwplayer.JWPlayerView<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; xmlns:jwp=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto&quot;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; android:id=&quot;@+id/JWPlayer&quot;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; android:layout_width=&quot;match_parent&quot;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; android:layout_height=&quot;match_parent&quot; /&gt;<br />
<br />
Playback<br />
These methods are used to retrieve and change the current playback state of the Player: is the Player idle, buffering, playing or paused.<br />
<br />
load(JWMediaSource jwMediaSource)<br />
The load method will load a media from a provided URL. Similar to the view properties, the Load method contains optional poster url and internal drawable to show as poster images.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Load media from a given JWMediaSource. This JWMediaSource can be a SingleSource if there is just a unique URL, or can be a MultipleQualityMediaSource if there are multiple qualities for a video.<br />
<br />
In case of MultipleQualityMediaSource the user needs to add a set of singles sources: e.g.<br />
<br />
MultipleQualityMediaSource jwMultipleSource = new MultipleQualityMediaSource();<br />
<br />
//This single source is the default video to playback<br />
SingleSource singleSourceHighQuality = new SingleSource(url, &quot;qualityTag&quot;, true);<br />
SingleSource singleSourceLowQuality = new SingleSource(url, &quot;qualityTag&quot;, false);<br />
<br />
jwMultipleSource.addMediaSource(singleSourceHighQuality);<br />
jwMultipleSource.addMediaSource(singleSourceLowQuality);<br />
<br />
getState()<br />
Get the state of the Player (IDLE, BUFFERING, PLAYING, or PAUSED)<br />
IDLE: either playback has not started or playback was stopped (due to a stop() call or an error). Either the play or the error icon is visible in the display.<br />
BUFFERING: user pressed play, but sufficient data to start playback has to be loaded first. The buffering icon is visible in the display.<br />
PLAYING: the video is currently playing. No icon is visible in the display.<br />
PAUSED: the video is currently paused. The play icon is visible in the display.<br />
<br />
pause(state)<br />
Toggles playback of the Player. If the state is set true the Player will pause, if set false the Player will start playing and if omitted, the Player will toggle playback.<br />
<br />
play(state)<br />
Toggles playback of the Player. If the state is set true the Player will start playing, if set false the Player will pause and if omitted, the Player will toggle playback.<br />
<br />
playAd(url)<br />
In addition to using a VAST ad schedule (see the &ldquo;Adding VAST Ads&rdquo; section below), the SDK supports playing ads on an ad-hoc basis using the playAd() method. Simply specify the URL of the VAST tag and the ad will play immediately.<br />
<br />
stop()<br />
Stops the Player (returning it to the IDLE state) and unloads the currently playing media file.<br />
<br />
onPlay(callback)<br />
Fired when the Player enters the PLAYING state. Event attributes:<br />
oldstate (String): the state the Player moved from. Can be BUFFERING or PAUSED.<br />
<br />
onPause(callback)<br />
Fired when the Player enters the PAUSED state. Event attributes:<br />
oldstate (String): the state the Player moved from. Can be BUFFERING or PLAYING.<br />
<br />
onBuffer(callback)<br />
Fired when the Player enters the BUFFERING state. Event attributes:<br />
oldstate (String): the state the Player moved from. Can be IDLE, PLAYING or PAUSED.<br />
<br />
onIdle(callback)<br />
Fired when the Player enters the IDLE state. Event attributes:<br />
oldstate (String): the state the Player moved from. Can be BUFFERING, PLAYING or PAUSED.<br />
<br />
onComplete(callback)<br />
Fired when an item completes playback. It has no event attributes.<br />
<br />
onError(callback)<br />
Fired when a media error has occurred, causing the Player to stop playback and go into IDLE mode. Event attributes:<br />
message (String): The reason for the error. See section on Error Messages for a list of possible media errors.<br />
Seeking<br />
These methods are used to retrieve and update the current media playback position.<br />
<br />
getPosition()<br />
Get the current playback position (playhead) in milliseconds, or -1 if playback is not active<br />
<br />
getDuration()<br />
Get the duration of the current media in milliseconds, or -1 if unknown. Note that the duration is not available until the first frame of the media has played.<br />
<br />
seek(position)<br />
Jump to the specified position within the currently playing media. The position is required and must be provided as an integer, in milliseconds.<br />
<br />
onSeek(callback)<br />
Fired after a seek has been requested either by scrubbing the controlbar or through the API. Event attributes:<br />
position (Number): The position of the Player before the Player seeks (in milliseconds).<br />
offset (Number): The user requested position to seek to (in milliseconds). Note the actual position the Player will eventually seek to may differ, e.g. because HLS can only seek to fragment boundaries.<br />
<br />
onTime(callback)<br />
While the Player is playing, this event is fired as the playback position gets updated. This may occur as frequently as 10 times per second. Event attributes:<br />
duration(Number): Duration of the current item in milliseconds.<br />
position(Number): Playback position in milliseconds.<br />
Controls and Fullscreen<br />
The controls of the Player (buttons, etc) should be configured using the layout XML properties of JWPlayerView. See the JWPlayerView description under &ldquo;Classes and Methods.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
The following methods allow you to use fullscreen features of the Player.<br />
<br />
getFullscreen()<br />
Find out whether the Player is currently playing in fullscreen mode. Returns either true or false.<br />
<br />
setFullscreen(boolean state, boolean allowRotation)<br />
Switch to fullscreen mode or back to windowed mode. Method parameters are:<br />
state: Set to true to make the player fullscreen, false to make windowed mode.<br />
allowRotation: Set to true to allow rotation of the phone to enter/exit fullscreen, false if rotation should be locked or only changed by another call to setFullscreen().<br />
<br />
onFullscreen(callback)<br />
Fired when the Player toggles to and from fullscreen. Event attributes:<br />
state (boolean): true for fullscreen, false for windowed mode<br />
userRequest (booelan): true if onFullscreen() was caused by the user tapping the fullscreen button, otherwise false.<br />
<br />
Autostart and Repeat<br />
The SDK exposes methods for controlling the Autostart and Repeat:<br />
<br />
setAutoStart(boolean)<br />
If set to true, the player will start media playback automatically.<br />
setRepeat(boolean)<br />
If set to true, the player will repeat the media (or playlist) automatically after completion.<br />
isAutoStart()<br />
Returns (true or false) whether or not the player is set to start media playback automatically.<br />
isRepeat()<br />
Returns (true or false) whether or not the player is set to repeat the media (or playlist) playback.<br />
Quality API Methods<br />
The SDK exposes the Quality API calls to allow app developers to switch video stream quality manually. This could be in response to changing network conditions, a user action, or other event. Call attributes are the same as with the web-based JW Player. This API is only relevant if multiple quality levels of the video are available (for example, from an HLS master playlist).<br />
<br />
Note: Quality switching using the Quality API is not the same as automatic adaptive HLS. When you switch streams using the Quality API, the new media stream is loaded and the player seeks to the playhead position.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
getQualityLevels(array)<br />
Returns an array with quality levels from the Player. Each level is an object that contains a label property from the NAME attribute in the HLS playlist.<br />
<br />
getCurrentQuality()<br />
Return the index of the current quality level.<br />
<br />
setCurrentQuality()<br />
The index of the desired quality level to set the Player to playback.<br />
<br />
<br />
onQualityLevels(callback)<br />
Fired when the list of available quality levels is updated. E.g., happens shortly after a playlist item starts playing.<br />
<br />
onQualityChange<br />
Fired when the active quality level is changed. E.g., happens in response to a user clicking the controlbar quality menu or a script calling setCurrentQuality.<br />
HLS Playlist Default Stream Variant<br />
The SDK always begins playback using the first stream variant in the HLs playlist. This is is accordance with the Apple recommended guidelines HLS (see https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/technotes/tn2224/_index.html) and is true whether you are using adaptive HLS in Android 4.x or the JW Player HLS fallback provider.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you want to start playback with a variant other than the first variant, use the setCurrentQuality() method in the Quality API. Note that this method cannot be called until onQualityLevels() method is called.<br />
<br />

Player States<br />
The following screens show the various playback states of the JW Player SDK for Android.<br />
<br />
Idle<br />
Before pressing play, the player displays the play icon. If a poster image is set for the media, that is also displayed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Paused<br />
When the player is paused, the control bar shows as well as the main play icon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Buffering&nbsp;<br />
While the player is buffering, the buffer icon shows along with the controlbar.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Controlbar<br />
Tapping on the screen shows the controlbar.<br />
<br />
<br />
Replay<br />
After the video as completed, the replay icon is visible which allows that media file to be replayed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Error State<br />
If the player cannot play back a media file, the view displays an error message.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quality Menu<br />
If multiple qualities are available for an HLS stream, a viewer can manually switch or stay on Auto.<br />
<br />
<br />
Creating a Custom Player Skin<br />
The SDK allows for custom skinning of the JW Android Media Player. The skinnable elements are made using Android 9 patch images.<br />
<br />
In order to create a custom skin, just add the resources on the project that is using the SDK with the same name as the asset that you want to replace and at the same level (folder by DPI, e.g: drawable-hdpi, drawable-mdpi). We recommend replacing assets for all DPI levels. See http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/screens_support.html for more details.<br />
<br />
Note: Skinning players using JW Player XML custom skins is not supported at this time.<br />

<br />
ControlBar Icon Padding<br />
To increase or decrease the padding around the control bar icons, modify your project&rsquo;s res/values/dimens.xml file to include integer properties for the following:<br />
<br />
controlbar_button_horizontal_padding - horizontal padding between icons (default is 10)<br />
controlbar_button_vertical_padding - vertical padding above/below icons and the top/bottom of the control bar (default is 3)<br />
controlbar_timerlabel_text_size - font size of the time elapsed and video running time numerals (default is 16)<br />
<br />
For example, to increase the padding and timer text:<br />
<br />
&lt;integer name=&quot;controlbar_button_horizontal_padding&quot;&gt;12&lt;/integer&gt;<br />
&lt;integer name=&quot;controlbar_button_vertical_padding&quot;&gt;5&lt;/integer&gt;<br />
&lt;integer name=&quot;controlbar_timer_text_size&quot;&gt;17&lt;/integer&gt;<br />
<br />
Important: You should test padding changes on a range of Android devices with different screen resolutions and pixel densities to ensure that the changes don&rsquo;t break the player UI.<br />
Skin Configuration Files<br />
display_buffer_rotate.xml&nbsp;<br />
Use this file to adjust the axis and frequency of rotation for the buffering state icon.<br />
Enabling and Disabling Player Controls<br />
In your activity&#39;s layout XML file, you can configure which controls appear in a player instance. These attributes are set in the &lt;com.longtailvideo.jwplayer.JWPlayerView&gt; element of the XML file.<br />
<br />
The following can be enabled/disabled:<br />
All controls<br />
Fullscreen button<br />
Video quality (i.e., the HD button)<br />
Video time played (time value on the left side of in the controlbar)<br />
Video duration (time value on the right side of in the controlbar)<br />
Seek bar<br />
Replay button when video completes<br />
JWP watermark logo<br />
<br />
For example, this code deactivates the full screen button and time played field:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;com.longtailvideo.jwplayer.JWPlayerView<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; xmlns:jwp=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto&quot;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; android:id=&quot;@+id/JWPlayer&quot;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; android:layout_width=&quot;match_parent&quot;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; android:layout_height=&quot;match_parent&quot;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; jwp:controls=&quot;true&quot;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; jwp:controlsFullscreen=&quot;false&quot;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; jwp:controlsQuality=&quot;true&quot;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; jwp:controlsTimePlayed=&quot;false&quot;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; jwp:controlsTotalDuration=&quot;true&quot;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; jwp:controlsSeekEnabled=&quot;true&quot;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; jwp:replayButtonEnabled=&quot;true&quot;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; jwp:jw_logo=&quot;false&quot;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;/&gt;<br />
Adding Captions<br />
The SDK supports adding caption tracks (subtitles) to video sources. At this time, the SDK only supports captions in SRT format.<br />
<br />
To add text captions to a video source, create a Subtitle object using the Subtitle constructor:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Subtitle(language, path, type)<br />
language. The two-letter language code of the captions according to ISO 639-1. For more information, see http://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Locale.html. If multiple language tracks are used, these codes will be shown in the captions menu of the player.<br />
path. The full path to the SRT file, either local (for example, SD card or local storage) or an HTTP/HTTPs URL.<br />
type. The format of the captions. Currently the only supported type is SUBTITLE_TYPE_SRT.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Once created, simply call addSubtitle(Subtitle) on the source previously created for each subtitle.<br />
<br />
To change the subtitle font size, override the integer property in your project&rsquo;s res/values/dimens.xml file by adding an integer property for jw_captions_text_size. The default size is 20. For example, to increase the font size to 24, add the following:<br />
<br />
&lt;integer name=&quot;jw_captions_text_size&quot;&gt;24&lt;/integer&gt;<br />

Adding VAST Ads<br />
The JW Player SDK for Android supports version 2.0 and later of the IAB VAST standard.&nbsp;<br />
Note that ads can also be fired on an ad hoc basis using the playAd() method.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
To set a VAST advertising break:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Create an a new ad break.<br />
AdBreak adBreak = new AdBreak();<br />
Set the type of the ad break. Supported types are PRE_ROLL, MID_ROLL or POST_ROLL.<br />
adBreak.setType(AdBreak.PRE_ROLL);<br />
Set the URL to the VAST tag of the ad.<br />
adBreak.setTag(URL TO VAST XML);<br />
If the ad is a midroll, specify an offset. The offset can be either a percentage (for example, &ldquo;20%&rdquo;), or seconds (for example, &ldquo;20&rdquo;). For pre and postrolls, the offset must be 0.&nbsp;<br />
In this example, the midroll ad will play 15 seconds into the main presentation.<br />
adBreak.setOffset(&ldquo;15&rdquo;);<br />
To specify multiple midrolls, just use multiple adBreak lines.<br />
Next, create an advertising for the source:<br />
Advertising advertising = new Advertising();<br />
To set a custom ad message on the control bar while the ad is displayed, use the setAdMessage method:<br />
advertising.setAdMessage(&lsquo;This is an ad&rsquo;);<br />
Note that if an ad message is specified in the VAST tag, the message in the VAST tag takes precedence and will be used instead of the custom ad message.<br />
Add the adBreak into the advertising:<br />
advertising.addBreak(adBreak);<br />
Set the advertising source to the JWMediaSource.<br />
currentSource.setAdvertising(advertising);<br />
<br />
Using Media Playlists<br />
Note: The playlists in this section are lists of distinct media sources, they do not refer to HLS playlists.<br />
<br />
In addition to loading a single media source, the SDK also supports loading a list of media sources. The player contains a public method load(List&lt;JWMediaSource&gt; mediaSourceList) that will create a playlist. Using the OnItemLoadedListener, it will return a Playlist, which is the current playlist loaded (can be one or multiple videos).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The public methods for Playlist are:<br />
first()<br />
Plays the first item on the playlist<br />
Returns a boolean to indicate whether or not the operation was successful.<br />
getCurrent()<br />
Returns the current mediaSource in the playlist.<br />
getCurrentIndex()<br />
Returns the index of the current media list item that is playing.<br />
getLastIndex()<br />
Returns the index of the last media in the list.<br />
getSize()<br />
Returns the number of items in the playlist.<br />
isFinished()<br />
Returns a boolean indicating whether or not the playlist has finished (i.e., played the last item in the list).<br />
isFirst()<br />
Returns a boolean indicating whether or not the current media is the first in the playlist.<br />
isLast()<br />
Returns a boolean indicating whether or not the current media is the last in the playlist.<br />
last()<br />
Plays the last source on the playlist.<br />
Returns a boolean indicating whether or not the operation was successful.<br />
next()<br />
Plays the next source on the playlist.<br />
Returns a boolean indicating whether or not the operation was successful.<br />
previous()<br />
Plays the previous source on the playlist.<br />
Returns a boolean indicating whether or not the operation was successful.<br />
skipTo(index)<br />
Plays the media at the specified index in the playlist.<br />
index is an integer indicating the index of the video to be played. (Note that the index count starts at zero, not one.)<br />
Returns a boolean indicating whether or not the operation was successful.
