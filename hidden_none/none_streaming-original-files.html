<p>An integral part of <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/products/jwplatform/" target="_blank">JW Platform</a> is the transcoding of your videos to formats that play on all browsers and devices. This workflow is the best fit for most publishers. However, in certain cases you might want to bypass our transcoding and directly playback the videos you upload. This article explains how to do so.</p>

<div class="article_callout">This document applies to users of <strong>JW Platform</strong>. Don&#39;t have Hosting? <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/pricing/">Upgrade Now</a>.</div>

<h2>Cases &amp; Limitations</h2>

<p>Here are some reasons for bypassing our transcoding we encountered over time:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Your original video is already web optimized. Transcoding that video again results in encoding artefacts.</li>
	<li>Your original video contains certain metadata, like TX3G or ID3. That data is lost in the transcoding process.</li>
	<li>Your original video is a screencast, with minimal motion and very large keyframe interval. Transcoding that video will result in larger files than the original.</li>
</ul>

<p>Beware that direct playback of original videos also has its limitations, most notably:</p>

<ul>
	<li>As a publisher, you are responsible for compatibility of your video with desktop browsers and mobile devices. This means your original video must be in MP4 format, with H.264 video and AAC audio.</li>
	<li>Since there is only one version of your original video, JW Player cannot automatically adapt video quality to available bandwidth. This means that people on low bandwidth (e.g. 3G) may have excessive buffering, while people with broadband could have been served a higher quality.</li>
	<li>Your original video is delivered as progressive download instead of through RTMP/HLS streaming. This means that seeking in long-form content will be slow, especially on iOS/Android devices.</li>
	<li>Since content encryption is part of the RTMP/HLS streaming, your video delivery will be less secure. For example, a user can open up his browser&#39;s developer tools to find and download your original video. This is not possible with RTMP/HLS.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Player Config</h2>

<p>Configuring JW Platform to play original videos is done in the <em>Players</em> section of the dashboard. For each player, there is a <strong>Streaming</strong> option that must be set to progressive download with the <em>Passthrough</em> template:</p>

<p><img alt="Video details streaming option" src="/customer/portal/attachments/257548" /></p>

<p>Every video that is now published with this player will have its original upload played, instead of the adaptive stream.</p>

<h2>Download Links</h2>

<p>It is also possible to grab a direct download link to your original passthrough (or any transcode for that matter). For that, go to the <em>Videos</em> section and click the video you need. In the video properties, go to the <em>Transcodes</em> tab:</p>

<p><img alt="Video details streaming option" src="/customer/portal/attachments/257557" /></p>

<p>Clicking the blue publish buttons will reveal the direct download link of the videos. You can use these links to embed your video in 3rd party video players or systems.</p>

<p>You can also right-click the blue publish buttons to <em>Save As...</em> the video file.</p>
