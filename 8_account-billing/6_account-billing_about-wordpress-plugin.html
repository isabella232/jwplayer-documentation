<h3>Settings Options</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Authorization:</strong> This is where you'll enter your API Key &amp; Secret</li>
<li><strong>Default Player:</strong> This player will be selected by default when you embed videos with the JW Player plugin. Edit this player, or any other player settings, from your <a href="https://dashboard.jwplayer.com/#/players/list" target="_blank">JW Player dashboard</a>. Each time you choose a video to embed, you will be able to select another player. If you use shortcodes, you can override the default player selection by adding a dash with the corresponding player key to the video key. (For example: <em>[jwplayer a1b2c3d4-z0y9x8w7]</em>) </li>
<li><strong>Authoring Page Widget: </strong>Check the "show" box to enable the easy-access widget directly on the Post Editing page. Whether or not this setting is enabled, you will always be able to access the JW Player plugin from the Add Media window.</li>
<li><strong>Videos in widget:</strong> When searching for existing videos, the widget and overlays are limited to displaying a certain number at a time. Specify that number here. If the video you're looking for does not appear within these results, refine your search terms. 
</li>
<li><strong>Timeout for signed links:</strong> text here about <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1433647-secure-platform-videos-with-signing" target="_blank">signed players</a>.

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p><h3>Does this plugin replace the old JW Player Plugin for Wordpress?</h3>
Yes, it does. You cannot run both plugins at the same time. However, you can import your referenced media, your players and your playlists from the old plugin into your JW Player account. </p>
<p><h3>Does this plugin work with caching solutions like WP-Supercache? </h3>
Yes, it does. However, you should disable the signing functionality of the plugin, since the caching might interfere with the signing timeout logic. In Wordpress, go to Settings &gt; JW Player and set the signing timeout to 0. </p>
<p><h3>Can I search through only my playlists in Wordpress?</h3>
<p> Yes, you can. In order to do this, simply write "pl:" (without the quotes) in front of your search query in the widget. </p>
</p>
