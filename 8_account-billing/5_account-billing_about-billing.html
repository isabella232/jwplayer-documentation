<p>This article explains JW Player Billing policy, procedure, and how to access Billing-related information. </p>
<h2>Pricing Structure</h2>
<p>JW Player has 3 tiers of <a href="https://www.jwplayer.com/pricing/">pricing</a>: Free, Premium, and Custom (our Enterprise and Ads editions). </p>
<p>JW Player Free and Premium licenses can be acquired through our <a href="https://www.jwplayer.com/pricing/">website</a>.
These licenses last for one year each. For the Premium edition, this
means that customers will pay for the entire year upon checkout.</p>
<p>JW Player Enterprise and Ads editions are subject to policies as
outlined in their contracts, as decided upon between the customer and
their JW Player sales representative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Billing &amp; Payment</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://dashboard.jwplayer.com/#/account/billing" target="_blank">Account &gt; Billing</a> section of the JW Player dashboard is a convenient way to manage your Billing &amp; Payment information. Here, you will find: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Product, pricing, and other inclusions <strong>information</strong> (for custom packages), as well as a link to contact Support about your account.</li>
  <li><strong>Billing email address</strong> &#8212; if you'd like, you may set one that is different from the main Account email address.</li>
  <li>Tools to <strong>update your payment method</strong>, credit card information, or other billing information.</li>
  <li>A table of your <strong>billing history</strong>, including access to past invoices.</li>
</ul>
<p>To access an <strong>invoice</strong> for a given statement date, click on the link in the table.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Renewal &amp; Cancellation</h2>
<p>By default, your JW Player License is set to auto-renew each year on
your renewal date.&nbsp; If you are using our Premium license and you
would like to cancel your subscription for any reason, visit <a href="http://dashboard.jwplayer.com/#/account/billing" target="_blank">Account &gt; Billing</a>
and click the "Cancel Subscription" link.&nbsp; Custom (Enterprise or
Ads) licenses may not be canceled via the dashboard and you must
contact your JW Player sales representative to discuss cancellation.<br>
