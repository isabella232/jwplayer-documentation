<p>This article explains JW Player Billing policy, procedure, and how to access Billing-related information. </p>
<h2>Pricing Structure</h2>
<p>JW Player has 3 tiers of pricing: Free, Premium, and Custom (our Enterprise and Ads editions). </p>
<p>JW Player Free and Premium licenses can be acquired through our <a>website</a>. These licenses last for one year each. For the Premium edition, this means that customers will pay for the entire year upon checkout.</p>
<p>JW Player Enterprise and Ads editions are subject to policies as outlined in their contracts, as decided upon between the customer and their JW Player sales representative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Billing &amp; Payment</h2>
<p>The <a href="http://dashboard.jwplayer.com/#/account/billing" target="_blank">Account &gt; Billing</a> section of the JW Player dashboard is a convenient way to manage your Billing &amp; Payment information. Here, you will find: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Product, pricing, and other inclusions <strong>information</strong> (for custom packages), as well as a link to contact Support about your account.</li>
  <li><strong>Billing email address</strong> &mdash; if you'd like, you may set one that is different from the main Account email address.</li>
  <li>Tools to <strong>update your payment method</strong>, credit card information, or other billing information.</li>
  <li>A table of your <strong>billing history</strong>, including access to past invoices.</li>
</ul>
<p>To access an <strong>invoice</strong> for a given statement date, click on the statement date link in the table.</p>

<h2>Renewal &amp; Cancellation</h2>
<p>By default, your JW Player License is set to auto-renew. If you would like to opt-out of auto-renewal, visit <a href="http://dashboard.jwplayer.com/#/account/billing" target="_blank">Account &gt; Billing</a> and click the "Cancel Subscription" link. In most cases, you will be able to finish using your purchased edition for the the remainder of the original term.</p>
<p><em><strong>But, there is an exception!</strong> If you purchased your player between X and Y dates, you may NOT have the option to opt-out of auto-renewal; rather, cancelling your subscription will result in an <strong>immediate downgrade</strong>. Please pay attention to the messaging at time of cancellation, just to be sure. </em></p> <!-- CHECK THE ABOVE -->
