<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Dashboard Homepage</h2>

<p>The dashboard homepage contains links to access important tools, like:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Player &amp; SDK downloads and license keys</li>
	<li>Blog posts about latest features and updates</li>
	<li>Support Articles and link to Contact Support</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="Welcome page" src="//support-static.jwplayer.com/images/acct-billing/welcome-page-2.png" /></p>

<p>It also contains information about new product releases, information about your account&#39;s usage (for <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2284233">Admin users</a> only), and the Quick Publish tool.</p>
<a name="quick-publish"></a>

<h3>Quick Publish Tool</h3>

<p>The Quick Publish Tool enables you to add content and get embed code right away via the <a href="#publish-mode">Publish Mode</a>.</p>

<p>Quick Publish accepts two types of content: <strong>Uploads</strong>, which can be added via a filepicker or drag &amp; drop, and <strong>externally-hosted URLs</strong>, which can be added via copy &amp; paste.</p>

<p>For information about adding files directly to the library (without publishing right away), read our article about <a href="#content">uploading content</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="Quick Publish" src="//support-static.jwplayer.com/images/acct-billing/quick-publish-2.png" /></p>

<a name="content"></a>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Content</h2>

<h3>Library and Playlists</h3>

<p>Under the content section you will find your video library and your playlists. You can add videos (or audio) by <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1469776">uploading files or adding external URLs</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="Content List" src="//support-static.jwplayer.com/images/discovery/content-list-short.png" style="max-width:100%;" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Content Detail</h3>

<p>Add tags, metadata, tracks and view sources for your video. Within the tracks tab, add and edit caption files using our <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/blog/new-video-caption-editor/" target="_blank"> captions editor tool</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="Content Detail" src="//support-static.jwplayer.com/images/acct-billing/content-detail.png" style="max-width:100%;" /></p>
<a name="publish-mode"></a>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Publish Mode</h2>

<p>You will notice the Publish Mode widget at the top of your Homepage, Content and Players List pages in the dashboard. Each &ldquo;Embed&rdquo; link or button opens Publish Mode, where you can find a single-line embed code for the player + content combination that you have selected.</p>

<p>From here, you can:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Click the &quot;change&quot; button next to the Player or Content to swap with other existing Players or Content</li>
	<li>Select &quot;javascript&quot; (recommended) or &quot;iframe&quot; for your embed type</li>
	<li>Include schema.org SEO tags &mdash; this automatically includes text from your video metadata in your embed code</li>
	<li>Click the &quot;preview page&quot; link to see a preview of your embed</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="Publish Mode" src="//support-static.jwplayer.com/images/acct-billing/publish-mode.png" /></p>
<a name="players"></a>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Players</h2>

<p>Create new players and edit existing ones in the <a href="https://dashboard.jwplayer.com/#/players/list">Players</a> section of your dashboard. All JW Player accounts come with two example players: one responsive and one fixed-width.</p>

<p>The player list gives you an overview of all of your players including a preview of their skins, their size, and their version numbers.</p>

<p>Your <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/2376965">License Keys &amp; Downloads</a> can also be accessed from this page.</p>

<p><img alt="The Player List Page" src="//support-static.jwplayer.com/images/faqs/player-list.png" /></p>

<p>Clicking on a player title in the players list will open the detail page for that player.</p>

<p><img alt="The Player Detail Page" src="//support-static.jwplayer.com/images/faqs/player-detail.png" /></p>

<p>Here, you can update settings for <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1406865">playback</a>, design, <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1409823">sharing</a>, <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/topics/564476">analytics</a>, and more.</p>

<p>On this page you&#39;ll also notice the Player Library URL tool &mdash; this gives you quick access to the library URL for this cloud player and its settings. <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1406723#option-2-cloud">Click here</a> to learn more about using player libraries.</p>
<a name="analytics"></a>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Analytics</h2>

<p>Monitor your content performance, and look at activity by device, geography, engagement, and more. Player activity is associated with a unique media ID, to ensure that everything is attributed accurately. Read more about <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2083166-new-analytics-about-the-media-id" target="_blank">Media IDs</a>, using the new analytics, and most importantly <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/2168318-jw-platform-analytics-what-s-new-" target="_blank">what&#39;s new in Analytics</a> as compared to your legacy JW Platform dashboard.</p>

<p><img alt="Analytics Dashboard" src="//support-static.jwplayer.com/images/acct-billing/analytics-dashboard.png" style="width: 500px; height: 390px;" /></p>
<a name="account"></a>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Account</h2>

<p>In the Account menu you will find access to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Your user <strong>Profile</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Properties</strong> management</li>
	<li><strong>User</strong> management</li>
	<li><strong>Usage</strong> analytics</li>
