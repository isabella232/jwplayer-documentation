<p>This
article provides an introduction to user management &amp; permissions
within a JW Player account. The User Management page can be found in
the dashboard under <a target="blank" href="https://dashboard.jwplayer.com/#/account/users">Account &gt; Users.</a></p>

<h2>Adding Users</h2>
<p>Now, all JW Player accounts can add and manage multiple users, with different permissions settings, on the same account.</p>
<div class="panel"><strong>Note:</strong> Email addresses being added as Users must not already be associated with an existing JW Player account.</div>
<h2>User Permissions</h2>
<p>In addition to giving access to additional email addresses, you may restrict that access by designating permissions as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ADMIN</strong> users have full account access (including Billing and User Management), as well as access to all Properties.</li>
  <li><strong>MANAGERS</strong> have access to most site areas &#8212; <strong>except</strong> Billing and User Management &#8212; and can be limited to certain Properties within an account. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are using the <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/2231363">Properties feature</a>,
when adding a Manager user you will also need to set which Properties
that user can access. (At least one Property must be allowed).</p>

<h2>Managing Existing Users</h2>
<p>All added users can be seen and managed from the "Existing Users" table. Here, you will see: </p>
<ol type="A">
<li>The user's email address</li>
<li>Their current permissions settings (editable from within the table) </li>
<li>Their status (whether or not they've accepted your invitation by setting a password for their account)</li>
<li>A delete button, should you need to remove the user from your account. </li>
</ol>
