<p>This article provides an introduction to user management &amp; permissions within a JW Player account. The User Management page can be found in the dashboard under Account &gt; Users. </p>
<p>[Insert Screenshot of account dropdown?] </p>
<h2>Adding Users</h2>
<p>Each account is entitled to add additional email addresses that may be used to log in and access various parts of the account, as long as the email addresses added are not already associated with an existing JW Player account.</p>
<p><em><strong> Quick tip:</strong> If you'd like to add a user who already has a separate JW Player account, you can use a "+" symbol with a string added to the email address to differentiate it. For example, if "user@example.com" were already associated with a JW Player account, I could add them as "user+1@example.com". </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>User Permissions</h2>
<p>In addition to giving access to additional email addresses, you may restrict that access by designating permissions as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ADMIN</strong> users have full account access (including Billing and User Management), as well as access to all Properties.</li>
  <li><strong>MANAGERS</strong> have access to most site areas &mdash; <strong>except</strong> Billing and User Management &mdash; and can be limited to certain Properties within an account. </li>
</ul>
<p>If you are using the <a href="properties-support-article">Properties feature</a>, when adding a Manager user you will also need to set which Properties that user can access. (At least one Property must be allowed).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Managing Existing Users</h2>
<p>All added users can be seen and managed from the "Existing Users" table. Here, you will see: </p>
<ol type="A">
<li>The user's email address</li>
<li>Their currently-set permissions (editable from within the table) </li>
<li>Their status (whether or not they've accepted your invitation by setting a password for their account)</li>
<li>A delete button, should you need to remove the user from your account. </li>
</ol>
