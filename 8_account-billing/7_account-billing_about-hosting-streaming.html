<h2>Hosting, Storage &amp; Streaming</h2>
<p>While JW Player is best-known for our javascript video player product of the same name, we have also offered a solution for hosting and delivering content since 2011. In fact, every JW Player account comes with some hosting and streaming already included. 
</p><p>
Our intelligent and efficient JW Platform powers JW Player's Hosting, Storage, and Streaming. Hosting your videos with the JW Platform means you'll get the highest performance out of your JW Player. Our content service is made to show off the intelligence and speed of JW Player, and our all-in-one solution means that with one click, you can upload and publish your videos anywhere. 
</p><p>
JW Platform offers transcoding, storage and delivery services that scale to support millions of videos and billions of streams a month. Beyond that, JW Platform provides analytics, data, discovery, and content protection tools that can be used in any combination, empowering you to make the most of your JW Player. JW Platform can be accessed via the <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/2160275">JW Player Dashboard</a>, or via the <a href="http://developer.jwplayer.com/jw-platform/">JW Platform API</a>. </p>
<p>
We measure JW Platform usage in terms of "<strong>storage</strong>" and "<strong>streaming</strong>". Both together are sometimes referred to as "<strong>hosting</strong>".

<h3>What is "Storage"? </h3>
<p>When you <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1469776">upload</a> your videos to the JW Platform, that counts towards your account's Storage limit. JW Player Free accounts have a complimentary <strong>5</strong>GB of Storage while paid editions start with <strong>50</strong>GB. This means that Free accounts may store (including original &amp; transcoded files) up to 5GB of video &mdash; whether many small videos, or fewer larger videos.</p>
<p>Storage is a limit that does not reset; if you exceed your account's storage limit, you will not be able to add more content until you <strong>(A)</strong> remove content that is already there, or <strong>(B)</strong> <a href="https://www.jwplayer.com/pricing/">upgrade</a> for more storage.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What is "Streaming"?</h3> 
<p>In the context of JW Platform, we use "Streaming" to mean "gigabytes delivered" to viewers. When a video is embedded on a page, it is streamed when it is downloaded by your users (this is also what happens when the video loads inside the player).</p>
<p> JW Player Free accounts come with a complimentary <strong>25</strong>GB of streaming per month, while paid accounts start from <strong>250</strong>GB per month. A <strong>25</strong>GB streaming allowance means that a <strong>5</strong>MB video file could be streamed (or "played") 5000 times.</p>
<p>If you exceed your account's streaming limit, <strong>streams will stop</strong> until (A) the end of the month, when streaming count resets, or (B) you <a href="https://www.jwplayer.com/pricing/">upgrade</a> for more streaming. Streaming limits do reset monthly, so if your account hits its limit just before the end of the month, and streams have stopped, as soon as the next month starts those streams will work again.  
</p><p>
"Streaming" sometimes also refers to "livestreaming", but it can also refer to video-on-demand. The JW Player &amp; Platform support many different streaming <a href="https://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1403635">formats</a>.
