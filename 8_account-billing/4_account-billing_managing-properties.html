TITLE: "Managing Properties"

-->

<p>This article is an introduction to the concept of "Properties" within JW Player accounts.</p>
<p>Properties enable users to maintain completely separate buckets of
players, content, and analytics, within a single JW Player account.
Each JW Player account, by default, begins with one all-encompassing
Property. If you would like to keep all of your players, content, and
analytics together, there is no need to use the Properties feature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Creating Properties </h2>
<p>You may find, however, that you'd like to maintain more than one
complete separate repository of players, content, and analytics. Your
organization might have completely independent teams that are all using
a single JW Player account, or you might work with clients and would
like to divide your account that way. Additionally, your organization
may once have operated under separate JW Player accounts &#8212; this will
allow you to consolidate those. </p>
<p>Whatever your reason, dividing up a JW Player account into Properties is straightforward. </p>
<ol>
  <li>Navigate to <a href="http://dashboard.jwplayer.com/#/account/properties">Account &gt; Properties</a> in your JW Player dashboard. </li>
  <li>Name your new Property, and click "create". </li>
</ol>
<p>And that's it!</p>

<p>Please note that all <strong>Admin</strong> users will immediately
have access to any new Properties created. By default, Manager users
will not have access to any additional Properties. To give access to
Manager users, navigate to the <a href="http://dashboard.jwplayer.com/#/account/users">Account &gt; Users</a> section, and allow access from the Existing Users table there. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Managing Properties </h2>
<p>You will see your new Property in the "Existing Properties" table,
also on this page. Once they're being used, here you will also see
information about the number of videos within each Property, streaming
usage, and number of users entitled to access it. </p>
<p>From this table, you may click to view the Property Settings page, where you may:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Rename a Property</strong> &#8212; do this by hovering over its title and clicking on the "edit" icon that appears there. </li>
  <li><strong>Copy the API Key and Secret</strong> for each Property </li>
  <li><strong>Jump</strong> to Content, Users, or Usage for each Property &#8212; do this by clicking on the links in each of those columns in the table.</li>
  <li>Configure <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1433702" target="_blank">DNS Masking</a>, <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1433647" target="_blank">URL Signing</a>, and <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/en/portal/articles/1995777" target="_blank">Geo-blocking</a><br>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Delete</strong> a Property<br>
    <em><strong>Be careful!</strong> Deleting a Property will also delete all content, players, and analytics from that Property. This action cannot be undone.</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Using Properties</h2>
<p>When multiple Properties are associated with an Account, Admin users
and Manager users who have access to more than one Property will be
able to switch between Property dashboard views from the Property
selector in the top navigation bar. </p>
<p><img alt="Properties Nav Dropdown" src="//support-static.jwplayer.com/images/acct-billing/properties-dropdown.png"/> </p>
<p>Manager Users who only have access to one Property will not see any sign of this feature. </p>

<p>As you will see, Players, Content, and Analytics are unique to each
Property, and therefore can only be viewed one Property at a time. When
coming back to the dashboard to edit or create players, or to upload or
modify content, be sure to first make certain you are viewing the
intended Property. </p>
<p>The Account section of the dashboard (Profile, Properties, Users,
Usage and Billing) is a global section, however, so Property views do
not apply when Admin users are in this section. </p>
