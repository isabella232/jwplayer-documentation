<p>In order to make the JW Player scaleable and adaptive to high resolution screens, JW7 no longer utilizes bitmap-based graphics. Instead, our skinning model relies on custom vector-based fonts and CSS. This ensures that all player elements will be at their sharpest when zoomed or scaled at higher resolutions. The article below explains how to make a custom icon set based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics">SVG files</a> and fonts.</p>

<h2>Creating the Font</h2>

<p>In order to get our icon fonts to work in all our target browsers, we need an icon font. All necessary font formats can be generated by using the <a href="https://icomoon.io/app/#/select">IcoMoon Web Font Generator</a> and then applying the resultant fonts into the JW Player vis CSS. Below is a step-by-step process of how this is accomplished:</p>

<p><strong>1 - </strong>Download the IcoMoon project file from our <a href="https://github.com/jwplayer/jwplayer/blob/master/assets/fonts/svg/jw7-icomoon-icon-setup.json">JW Player github project</a>. This JSON file contains our current icons and their related settings.</p>

<p><strong>2 - </strong>On the IcoMoon web page, import the aforementioned project file using the <strong>Import Icons</strong> button in the top left corner of the page:<br />
<br />
<img src="//support-static.jwplayer.com/images/ico-import.png" /><br />
<br />
Upon importing, the player icons should appear at the top of the page. A successful import should display the following:<br />
<br />
<img src="//support-static.jwplayer.com/images/ico-fonts.png" /></p>

<p>Now that we&#39;ve imported our icons, it&#39;s time to make some modifications.</p>

<h2>Editing Icons</h2>

<ol>
	<li>Highlight the icon that you wish to modify by clicking on it. A highlighted icon will appear with a gold border.</li>
	<li>Select the Pencil icon at the top of the page to initiate the editing.</li>
	<li>Make any changes to the icon that you wish.</li>
</ol>

<p>For this example, I&#39;ve simply mirrored all of our icons. The results are reflected below:</p>
<img src="//support-static.jwplayer.com/images/ico-reverse.png" />
<h2>Exporting the Font</h2>

<p>Once you are happy with your modified/added icons, it&#39;s time to export the result:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Save a copy - </strong>Click the three-lined option menu again and select the &quot;Download JSON&quot; button. This JSON file will act as a backup, allowing you to edit your completed icon set in the future.</li>
	<li><strong>Download the Font - </strong>Export the font itself by clicking the <strong>Generate Font</strong> button at the bottom right:<br />
	<img src="//support-static.jwplayer.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/ico-gen.png" /><br />
	You&#39;ll now see the button change to a <strong>Download</strong> button with a settings gear.<br />
	<img src="//support-static.jwplayer.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/ico-pref.png" /><br />
	Click this <strong>Settings</strong> gear. Here you should make sure that <strong>Class Prefix</strong> is set to <strong>jw-icon-</strong>. The font name will be inherrited as the file name.<br />
	<img src="//support-static.jwplayer.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/ico-prefs.png" />
	<p>Ensuring that the correct values are set here will configure a lot of the CSS classes for you. It&#39;s now safe to close the options pane.</p>
	</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>Download</strong> link to download a zip file that contains your new font.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Applying the Font</h2>

<p>With the fonts created and downloaded, we can now replace existing JW7 icons. The step-by-step process below will explain how:</p>

<h3>Step 1 - Unpacking your zip</h3>

<p>Unpack your zip to view the included font files. These are conveniently located in the <strong>font</strong> folder.</p>

<h3>Step 2 - Relocate the fonts</h3>

<p>Copy the .eot, .svg, .ttf, and .woff files into a desired font directory. If this is an online directory, ensure that all files are able to be accessed from your domain of choice.</p>

<h3>Step 3 - Load your font</h3>

<p>We&#39;ll need to load our font via CSS using <strong>@font-face</strong>, as well as provide a <strong>font-family</strong> name. In this case, the <strong>jw-custom-icons.woff</strong> file has been relocated to a <strong>font</strong> subdirectory. I will also be naming this font-family <strong>custom</strong>.</p>

<pre>
&lt;style&gt;
@font-face {
	font-family: &#39;custom&#39;;
    src: url(&#39;fonts/jw-custom-icons.woff&#39;);
}
&lt;/style&gt;
</pre>

<p>Note that this example will be using <strong>only</strong> a .woff file. For more extensive browser compatibility, please see the <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/using-font-face/">css-tricks article</a> which details the loading of multiple fonts.</p>

<h3>Apply the Font</h3>

<p>Finally, we need to apply the new font to our player. This is accomplished with one line of CSS to apply the <strong>custom</strong> font-family name.</p>

<pre>
.jw-icon{font-family:&#39;custom&#39;};
</pre>

<p>Note, the font-family is referred to as <strong>custom</strong> due to our naming in step 3.</p>

<h3>The Results</h3>

<p>Our inverted icons are now applied to our control bar and we have a backwards, bizarro JW Player! (Or perhaps a WJ Player?)</p>
<style type="text/css">@font-face {
	font-family: 'custom';
    src: url('//support-static.jwplayer.com/fonts/jw-custom-icons.woff');
}
.jw-icon{font-family:'custom'};
</style>
<div id="container">&nbsp;</div>
<script>
var playerInstance = jwplayer("container");
playerInstance.setup({
playlist: '//content.jwplatform.com/jw6/vqtiNOP4.xml'
});
</script>
</body>
</html>
