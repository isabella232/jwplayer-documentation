<p>Using the Platform API, you can allow your users to upload videos to your account directly from your website. This is a useful if you have your own CMS and wish to enable your users to upload videos, or if you wish to allow for user generated content for e.g. a competition.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>A video upload to JW Platform consists of a few steps. These are described in detail in the <a href="http://developer.jwplayer.com/jw-platform/reference/v1/methods/videos/create.html">API documentation</a>. Here&#39;s a high-level overview:</p>

<ul>
	<li>First, the client does a <a href="http://developer.jwplayer.com/jw-platform/reference/v1/methods/videos/create.html">/videos/create</a> API call. This call sets up our server to receive the video. The server returns an object with upload data.</li>
	<li>Second, the client uses the returned object to construct an upload URL. The video upload form should be posted to this URL.</li>
	<li>Third, the client posts the video to the upload URL. Using JavaScript, the upload progress can be displayed.</li>
	<li>Fourth, after the upload has completed the server redirects to a page on the client&#39;s site again. The client can display an <em>Upload completed</em> message on this redirected page and show more info on the uploaded video.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Setting Up</h2>

<p>It is quite straightforward to implement this on your own web server. All you need is a server with a fairly up to date version of PHP and CURL installed. Then download the <a href="http://support-static.jwplayer.com/API/php-api-examples-20151013.zip">PHP API Examples</a> zip file.</p>

<p>The upload folder has a self-contained demo. All you need to edit is the botr/init_api.php file and enter your account key and secret. Your account key and secret can be found in the settings tab of your account (on the right-hand site of the page).</p>

<p>This example uses quite a few fairly advanced JavaScript tricks; it detects whether browsers support resumable uploads before performing a /videos/create call, and if resumable uploads are supported it sends over the video in smaller chunks. We recommend that you adopt this example verbatim unless you&#39;re comfortable reading and adapting the source code of this example.</p>

<p>Please note that this example allows anyone to upload a video, so we recommend that you only allow registered/authorized users in your CMS access the upload page in order to prevent abuse.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://developer.jwplayer.com/jw-platform/reference/v1/methods/videos/create.html">/videos/create call</a>, <a href="http://developer.jwplayer.com/jw-platform/reference/v1/uploads.html">file uploads</a> and <a href="http://developer.jwplayer.com/jw-platform/reference/v1/resumable_uploads.html">resumable uploads</a> documentation pages contain in-depth technical documentation on how to perform file uploads to JW Platform.</p>
