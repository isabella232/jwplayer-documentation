<p>One of the strengths of <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/products/jwplatform/" target="_blank">JW Platform</a> is its deep integration with JW Player. All features of the player can be configured using the platform&#39;s point &amp; click interface, in the <em>Players</em> section of the dashboard:</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>JW Platform allows you to create multiple templates of JW Player. Each template contains settings for player layout, playback behaviour (e.g. autostart) video advertising and 3rd party integrations. Whenever you publish a video or playlist, you select a player template to use. Here are two player examples:</p>

<p><img alt="player template examples" src="/customer/portal/attachments/257539" /></p>

<p>Any updates you make to your players are reflected for videos already published with this player. This setup makes players a powerful tool to e.g. change advertising options or site design without updating all individual embed codes.</p>

<h2>Editing Players</h2>

<p>New JW Platform accounts already have some preset templates. You can choose to edit these or create new players with the <em>Create New Player</em> button in the players overview page. Both actions direct you to the player properties page:</p>

<p><img alt="player properties page" src="/customer/portal/attachments/257540" /></p>

<p>This page shows a preview of your player template, with all properties grouped in 5 sections below:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>General</strong>: Set the player&#39;s name, as well as its dimensions and skin.</li>
	<li><strong>Layout</strong>: Show or hide the controls, the playlist and a custom logo.</li>
	<li><strong>Playback</strong>: Set playback options like autostart, repeating and streaming.</li>
	<li><strong>Advertising</strong>: Insert IAB or IMA ads and control their user experience.</li>
	<li><strong>Integrations</strong>: Connect to Google/Adobe Analytics and set Sharing/Related overlays.</li>
</ul>

<p>Most properties are available to all JW Platform customers, but the <em>Advertising</em> section and <em>SiteCatalyst</em> integration are only available if you have also purchased JW Ads. Please contact your account representative for more info.</p>

<h2>Player Properties</h2>

<p>Nearly all player properties displayed in the dashboard map directly to <a href="/customer/portal/articles/1413113-configuration-options-reference">JW Player configuration options</a>. Only the following properties need some further explanation:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="/customer/portal/articles/1483088-social-sharing-with-jw-platform">Social Sharing</a> goes beyond the overlay, enabling inline Facebook/Twitter playback.</li>
	<li><a href="/customer/portal/articles/1483102-related-videos-with-jw-platform">Related Videos</a> are automatically calculated based upon your video&#39;s tags.</li>
	<li><a href="/customer/portal/articles/1483106-video-ads-in-jw-platform">Advertising</a> is incredibly straightforward to setup and modify with JW Platform.</li>
	<li>Video Streaming allows you to disable adaptive in favor of <a href="/customer/portal/articles/1483133-streaming-your-original-videos">your original uploads</a>.</li>
</ul>
