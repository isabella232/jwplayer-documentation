<p>This article introduces the video upload &amp; management capabilities of <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/products/jwplatform/" target="_blank">JW Platform</a>. Additionally, we&#39;ll also go over different settings that correspond to custom ad insertion, publish dates, and general media organization. All of these options can be found in the <em>Videos</em> section of the dashboard.</p>

<h2>Uploading your content</h2>

<p>Start the upload process by clicking the big <em>Upload New Video</em> button at the right side. Insert basic metadata for the video in the overlay, then move on to select your file:</p>

<p><img alt="videos upload overlay" src="/customer/portal/attachments/257189" /></p>

<p>Note: if you have an HTML5 browser, you can also use the multi-file uploader. It is linked right below the big <em>Upload New Video</em> button.</p>

<p>In terms of supported formats, we accept nearly any audio or video. This includes video in MP4, MOV, FLV, MPG, AVI and DV format, or audio in MP3, AAC, WAV, ASF, PCM, M4A or AIFF format. Notable exceptions include content that use the Apple Intermediate, Apple ProRes or GoToMeeting video codecs. We also don&#39;t support content that is encrypted with DRM.</p>

<p>Note: do not close your browser while video upload is in progress, since that will cancel the upload!</p>

<h2>Setting Metadata</h2>

<p>Every video uploaded to JW Platform has its own properties page:</p>

<p><img alt="videos details page" src="/customer/portal/attachments/256823" /></p>

<p>On this page, you can:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Edit video metadata, like its title, description and tags. Tags are used to segment your video library.</li>
	<li>Set a preview thumbnail, either by uploading your own image or selecting a frame from the video.</li>
	<li>Upload a new version of the video. This is great for when it is already live, since embeds don&#39;t change.</li>
	<li>Grab direct links to your video transcodes. Note it always takes a while before these files are ready.</li>
	<li>Upload text tracks, like captions or chapters. Uploads should be in <a href="#">WebVTT or SRT/DFXP format</a>.</li>
	<li>Grab embed codes to publish the video to your site.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Custom Video Properties</h2>

<p>Using custom metadata can be very useful when keeping track of, or displaying, pertinent video information. For example, when loading episodes of a show, you can use this to track things like season number, episode number, featured actors, or production date. This information is then stored inside of a playlist object and can be utilized with JW Player&#39;s <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1413089-javascript-api-reference#playlist" target="_blank">Playlist API</a>.</p>

<p>Custom properties can be accessed by clicking on the <strong>METADATA</strong> section within a video object&#39;s properties.</p>
<img src="http://support-static.jwplayer.com/images/metadata.png" style="height: 516px; width: 600px;" />
<p>The above variables will then be stored within a playlist as:</p>

<pre>
&lt;jwplayer:keywords&gt;trailer, superhero, movie&lt;/jwplayer:keywords&gt;
&lt;jwplayer:mediaid&gt;iidx573&lt;/jwplayer:mediaid&gt;
</pre>

<p>In addition to media organization, such playlist information can also be used as values for targeted ads with our VAST client. This method requires the use of <strong>custom ad tag variables</strong>, which are mentioned <a href="http://support.jwplayer.com/customer/portal/articles/1434340-ad-tag-variables#playlist" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Media Sunrising</h2>

<p>Media sunrising is a feature that allows a publisher to choose a particular date and time that they would like to have a piece of media publicly available. This feature works in conjunction with the &#39;publish date&#39; metadata field within a particular video object.</p>
<img src="http://support-static.jwplayer.com/images/mediasunrise.png" style="width: 600px;" />
<p>Due to different time zones, dates configured for media are centered around UTC. Specifying a time in UTC will localize publish time based on the utilized computer&#39;s own timezone settings and show this updated information below.</p>

<p>If a future publish date is specified, this means:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Content (Meaning transcoded files, images, etc.) will not be accessible publicly</li>
	<li>Content will not appear in playlists, either dynamically or statically</li>
	<li>Media will continue to be privately accessible/modifiable via API and dashboard</li>
</ul>

<p>Once a publish date/time is reached, media can be accessed by public viewers.</p>

<h2>Publishing Videos</h2>

<p>Hitting the <em>Embed This Video</em> button will popup the publishing overlay:</p>

<p><img alt="videos details page" src="/customer/portal/attachments/256824" /></p>

<p>Here, select which player design you want to use to publish your video. Next, copy/paste the resulting embed code into your own website or blog. A preview of your video+player is shown below the code.</p>

<p>Use the small links at the bottom to quickly publish the video to Facebook, to Twitter, or to Email in a preview page.</p>
