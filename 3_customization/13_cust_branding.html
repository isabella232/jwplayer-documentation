<p>JW Player 7 supports both the addition of logo or watermark, as well as a custom text link inside of the right click menu. Each of these features is now fully supported with JW Player 7 across all versions, including free.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> JW Player 6 and below require a paid subscription to access these features. If you are still seeing a JW Player watermark, or cannot configure your right click or logo, you will need to update to JW Player 7.0 or higher.</p>

<h2>Adding your brand</h2>

<p>The logo and right click options are a great way to easily brand your video player, while driving traffic to your website.</p>

<h2>Setting the Logo</h2>

<p>A dedicated options block, called <strong>logo</strong>, is available for configuring the logo. This feature works by layering your logo on top of JW Player and does not affect the video file itself. Directly viewing a video or stream outside of JW Player will not have this logo applied to the content.</p>

<p>The addition of your logo has the following configurable properties:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>file</dt>
	<dd>Location of an external JPG, PNG or GIF image to be used as watermark (e.g. <strong>/assets/logo.png</strong>). We recommend using 24 bit PNG images with transparency, since they blend nicely with the video.</dd>
	<dt>hide</dt>
	<dd>By default (<strong>false</strong>), the logo remains visible all the time. When this option is set to <strong>true</strong>, the logo&#39;s visibility is synced with the visibility of other player control elements.</dd>
	<dt>link</dt>
	<dd>The HTTP URL which will load when your watermark image is clicked. (e.g. <strong>http://www.mywebsite.com/</strong>). If this is not set, a click on the watermark will not do anything.</dd>
	<!--<dt>margin</dt>
	<dd>The distance of the logo from the edges of the display in pixels. The default is <strong>8</strong> pixels.</dd> Adjusting this will adjust both the horizontal and vertical margins.
	<dt>position</dt>
	<dd>This sets the corner in which to display the watermark. It can be <strong>top-right</strong> (the default), <strong>top-left</strong>, <strong>bottom-right</strong> or <strong>bottom-left</strong>. The default position is preferred, since the logo won&#39;t interfere with the controlbar, captions, overlay ads and dock buttons.</dd>-->
</dl>

<h2>Setting the Right-click</h2>

<p>The right-click does not have a dedicated options block. Instead, two simple global configuration options are available:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>abouttext</dt>
	<dd>Additional text which will display in the right-click menu. This must be set in order to use <strong>aboutlink</strong></dd>
	<dt>aboutlink</dt>
	<dd>The URL then will open when a user clicks on <strong>abouttext</strong>. If this is not set, custom text will redirect to <strong>http://www.jwplayer.com/learn-more/</strong>.</dd>
</dl>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> JW Player 7 does not have a way to fully remove the &quot;About JW Player&quot; text.</p>

<h2>Branding Example</h2>

<p>The appearance of JW Player&#39;s right click and logo customizations can be seen below:</p>

<div id="container">&nbsp;</div>
<script>
var playerInstance = jwplayer("container");
playerInstance.setup({
  file: "//content.jwplatform.com/videos/3XnJSIm4-640.mp4",
  image: "//content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/3XnJSIm4-640.jpg",
  width: 640,
  height: 270,
  logo: {
    file: "//content.jwplatform.com/watermarks/gdz4zR4a.png",
    link: "//www.blender.org/foundation/"
  },
  abouttext: 'Video Available at Blender.org',
  aboutlink: 'http://www.blender.org'
});
</script>

<p>Here is the configuration of above example:</p>

<pre>
var playerInstance = jwplayer(&quot;myElement&quot;);
playerInstance.setup({
	file: &quot;/assets/myVideo.mp4&quot;,
	image: &quot;/assets/myVideo.jpg&quot;,
	logo: {
		file: &#39;/assets/blenderLogo.png&#39;,
		link: &#39;http://www.blender.org/foundation/&#39;
	},
	abouttext: &quot;Video Available at Blender.org&quot;,
	aboutlink: &quot;http://www.blender.org&quot;,
	width: 640,
	height: 270
});
</pre>
