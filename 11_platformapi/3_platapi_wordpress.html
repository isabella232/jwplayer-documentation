<p>Our official JW Platform <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/bits-on-the-run/">WordPress plugin</a> is a great tool for publishers using the WordPress CMS for their sites. This plugin enables uploading, searching and embedding videos, directly from within the WordPress post/page editor.</p>

<div class="article_callout">This document applies to users of <strong>JW Platform</strong>. Don&#39;t have Hosting? <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/pricing/">Upgrade Now</a>.</div>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p>Installing the WordPress plugin is a breeze:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Download the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/bits-on-the-run/">WordPress plugin</a> and unzip.</li>
	<li>Copy the resulting <em>bits-on-the-run</em> folder into the <strong>/wp-content/plugins/</strong> directory of your WordPress installation.</li>
	<li>Login to your WordPress site and go to the <strong>Plugins</strong> page.</li>
	<li>There will be a <strong>jwplatform</strong> plugin in your plugin list. Click <strong>activate</strong> to enable the plugin.</li>
	<li>Now, go to the <strong>Settings &raquo; Media</strong> page in WordPress.</li>
	<li>Under the JW Platform header log in to JW Platform in order to link your Wordpress blog to your JW Platform account</li>
	<li>Save the WordPress settings.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your integration between WordPress and JW Platform is now set up. Feel free to change additional settings, such as the default player to use in your WordPress posts:</p>

<p><img alt="WordPress settings page" src="/customer/portal/attachments/239076" /></p>

<p>In addition to this, you may choose to enable the widget in the authoring pages. By default, the widget is only available in the <em>Add&nbsp;media</em> window, which is accessible by clicking one of the icons after the <em>Upload/Insert</em> text, right above the text area.</p>

<h2>Posting</h2>

<p>With the setup completed, you will see a new tab in your <em>Add&nbsp;media</em> window. This tab shows a list of videos in your JW Platform account, plus a small form for uploading additional videos.</p>

<p><img alt="WordPress &quot;Add media&quot; window" src="/customer/portal/attachments/239077" /></p>

<p>Depending on your setings, the contents of this tab are also available as a box in the sidebar of the <em>Edit&nbsp;Post</em> page.</p>

<p>By default, your 5 newest videos are shown. Use the inline search field to find other videos, and to search playlists. Click on a video to insert it into your post. To only search your playlists, prefix your search by &quot;playlist:&quot; (without the quotes)..</p>

<p>The video upload form works exactly like within our dashboard. You can set a title for the video and browse for the original file on your computer. When submitting the upload, a bar will display the upload progress. After the upload has completed, the uploaded video will appear at the top of your video list.</p>

<h2>Signing</h2>

<p>JW Platform videos are embedded in a post with a so-called <strong>quicktag</strong>. Here&#39;s an example:</p>

<p>Our plugin will convert this quicktag into an embed code when the post page is displayed to a visitor. As part of this, our plugin can also sign your embed code, in case you have enabled the <a href="/customer/portal/articles/1433647-token-signing-with-jw-platform">player security settings</a> for your account.</p>

<p>The setting for the signing timeout can be found under <em>Settings &gt; Media</em>. By default, signing is disabled, since the timeout is set to 0. This because caching plugins like WP-supercache interfere with the signing. If you don&#39;t use caching, or make sure to set your signing timeout larger than the caching time, you can enable the signing by setting a timeout &gt; 0.</p>

<h2>Players</h2>

<p>By default, videos are embedded with the player you set up in the Media settings tab. Changing this setting will change the player in all videos you embedded in your WordPress site.</p>

<p>However, it is possible to override this setting and have a video embedded with a specific player. Therefore, also insert the <strong>key</strong> of the player you want to use in the quicktag:</p>

<p>You can find the <strong>key</strong> of your players in the <a href="http://dashboard.jwplatform.com/players/">dashboard player section</a>.</p>
