<div class="article_callout">This document only applies to <strong>JW Player Enterprise</strong> users. Don&#39;t have Enterprise or our <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/products/mobile-sdk/" target="_blank">Android SDK</a>?<br />

<p><br />
The JW Player SDK for Android has media classes and methods that enable developers to build JW Player directly into any Android application, expanding your content reach to include a wider mobile audience.</p>

<h3><br />
<strong>Q: How do I get the Android SDK? How do I use the Android SDK?</strong></h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Please use our <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/contact-us/enterprise/">contact form</a> so we can work with you to understand your requirements.</p>

<h3><br />
<strong>Q: Is the JW Player Android SDK included with my Enterprise license?</strong></h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> No, the Android SDK is priced separately and is considered a different product. Use our <a href="http://www.jwplayer.com/contact-us/enterprise/">contact us</a> form to reach out to a friendly JW Player representative for more pricing information</p>

<h3><br />
<strong>Q: I&#39;ve purchased the SDK software, but where do I download it?</strong></h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> If you have an SDK license, a download link will appear in your <a href="https://dashboard.jwplayer.com/#/account/advanced">JW Player account dashboard</a>. If you&#39;re not seeing a download link, please contact your JW Player account representative.</p>

<h3><br />
<strong>Q: When I create a JWPlayerView and add a source, I get an error &quot;License Key Not Found&quot;.</strong></h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Either you do not have a JW product key, or the key you have is not an Enterprise key. Contact <strong>support@jwplayer.com</strong> to validate your key.<br />
Also, make sure the <meta-data android:name="JW_LICENSE_KEY"> element is inside the closing tag in your project&rsquo;s AndroidManifest.xml file.</p>

<h3><br />
<strong>Q: When I launch my emulator, I see all kinds of errors and strange behavior.</strong></h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> <strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: The Android Media Player is known to be unstable when running in Android emulators, often throwing &quot;Unknown Android MediaPlayer error (extra = -2147483648).&quot; We strongly recommend using physical devices to develop and test apps you build with the JW Player SDK.</p>

<h3><br />
<strong>Q: The demo app is buggy/tricky to use.</strong></h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> The sample app is intended only to allow for a quick and easy way to see a number of streaming and progressive download video playback examples, with and without VAST based video advertising, and to illustrate how the API in the library can be used.</p>

<h3><br />
<strong>Q: When building my app, I get the error:<br />
Could not GET&nbsp;https://mvn.jwplayer.com/content/repositories/<br />
releases/com/longtailvideo/jwplayer/<br />
jwplayer-android-sdk/&#39;. Received status code 401 from server: Unauthorized.</strong></h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> You have entered an incorrect username or password for the JW Player maven repository in your AndroidManifest.xml file. Contact <strong>support@jwplayer.com</strong> for correct login credentials.</p>

<h3><br />
<strong>Q: Can I get the source code for the demo app?</strong></h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> The demo application source code for our 2.x Android SDK now lives on GitHub at:<br />
https://github.com/jwplayer/jwplayer-sdk-android-demo</p>

<h3><br />
<strong>Q: Can I try my own video URL in the demo app?</strong></h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, all you need to do is configure your PlaylistItem object.</p>

<h3><br />
<strong>Q: How do I remove the demo app from my device?</strong></h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> To uninstall the demo app, long-tap the JW Player Mobile icon in the app drawer, and drag it to the top of the screen to the Uninstall bar.</p>
