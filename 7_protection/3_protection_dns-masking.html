<p>This article explains what DNS masking is and how to DNS mask the JW Platform content servers (<em>content.jwplatform.com</em>)</p>


<h2>What is DNS masking?</h2>

<p>With DNS masking you can make it look like the JW Platform embed
codes are part of your domain instead of hosted on a third party
service. People looking in your HTML code will see e.g. <em>cdn.example.com</em> instead of <em>content.jwplatform.com</em>.</p>

<p>It also means that, if you have enabled the sharing plugin, the
shared embed codes will contain your own domain name. This looks more
professional towards your customers.</p>

<p>Player embeds (script, iframe, embed), preview thumbnails, RSS feeds
and video downloads all benefit from DNS Masking.&nbsp; NOTE: If you're
using HTTPS, DNS masking will not work for you becausewe cannot host your SSL certificate.&nbsp;  <br>
</p>

<h2>1: Setup a DNS Mask with your Domain Provider<br>
</h2>

<p>Technically, DNS masking is accomplished by setting up a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNAME_record">CNAME record</a>. <strong>You have to do this yourself</strong> with the company that manages your domain name. We cannot do this for you.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Note you do not have to use a subdomain called <em>content</em>. You can use any string (e.g. <em>video</em> or <em>cdn</em>).</li>
	<li>Also note the record type should be <strong>CNAME</strong>.</li>
	<li>Last, the <em>dot</em> after content.jwplatform.com. is <strong>required</strong>. Don't forget it!</li>
</ul>

<p>It can take up to a couple of hours for the new CNAME record to
propagate. Once it has completed you should see your data load if you
replace our domain name with yours. <a href="http://content.jwplatform.com/thumbs/nPripu9l-120.jpg">Here's a simple example image to test</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>2: Add the CNAME in your Dashboard<br>
</h2>

<p>Once the DNS mask is active, you should add the CNAME to your
dashboard, under the Account &gt; Properties settings section, so we
can start using the mask for your account.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the DNS mask registered with us:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The embed codes and source URLs in the dashboard (players, downloads, playlists) will then use your domain.</li>
	<li>The embed codes in the <em>sharing</em> dialog in your players will then use your domain.</li>
</ul>

<p>After having entered the DNS mask in the Dashboard, you're all set!</p>
